<br><font color="#999999">The Vanity of Life</font><br><br>1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
2 “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.”
3 What profit has a man from all his labor In which he toils under the sun?
4 <font color="#999999"><em>One</em></font> generation passes away, and <font color="#999999"><em>another</em></font> generation comes; But the earth abides forever.
5 The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose.
6 The wind goes toward the south, And turns around to the north; The wind whirls about continually, And comes again on its circuit.
7 All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not full; To the place from which the rivers come, There they return again.
8 All things <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> full of labor; Man cannot express <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font> The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing.
9 That which has been <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> what will be, That which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> done is what will be done, And <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> nothing new under the sun.
10 Is there anything of which it may be said, “See, this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> new”? It has already been in ancient times before us.
11 <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> no remembrance of former <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> Nor will there be any remembrance of <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> that are to come By <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> who will come after.
<br><font color="#999999">The Grief of Wisdom</font><br><br>12 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
13 And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised.
14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind.
15 <font color="#999999"><em>What is</em></font> crooked cannot be made straight, And what is lacking cannot be numbered.
16 I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge.”
17 And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.
18 For in much wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> much grief, And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Vanity of Pleasure</font><br><br>1 I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure”; but surely, this also <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> vanity.
2 I said of laughter — “Madness!”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?”
3 I searched in my heart <font color="#999999"><em>how</em></font> to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.
4 I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards.
5 I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all <font color="#999999"><em>kinds</em></font> of fruit trees in them.
6 I made myself water pools from which to water the growing trees of the grove.
7 I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me.
8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> musical instruments of all kinds.
9 So I became great and excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.
10 Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, For my heart rejoiced in all my labor; And this was my reward from all my labor.
11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done And on the labor in which I had toiled; And indeed all <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind. <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> no profit under the sun.
<br><font color="#999999">The End of the Wise and the Fool</font><br><br>12 Then I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly; For what <font color="#999999"><em>can</em></font> the man <font color="#999999"><em>do</em></font> who succeeds the king? — <font color="#999999"><em>Only</em></font> what he has already done.
13 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly As light excels darkness.
14 The wise man’s eyes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in his head, But the fool walks in darkness. Yet I myself perceived That the same event happens to them all.
15 So I said in my heart, “As it happens to the fool, It also happens to me, And why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart, “This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.”
16 For <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever, Since all that now <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> will be forgotten in the days to come. And how does a wise <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> die? As the fool!
17 Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> distressing to me, for all <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind.
18 Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
19 And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.
20 Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun.
21 For there is a man whose labor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and a great evil.
22 For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?
23 For all his days <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.
24 Nothing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better for a man <font color="#999999"><em>than</em></font> that he should eat and drink, and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God.
25 For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
26 For <font color="#999999"><em>God</em></font> gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to <font color="#999999"><em>him who is</em></font> good before God. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Everything Has Its Time</font><br><br>1 To everything <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> a season, A time for every purpose under heaven:
2 A time to be born, And a time to die; A time to plant, And a time to pluck <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> planted;
3 A time to kill, And a time to heal; A time to break down, And a time to build up;
4 A time to weep, And a time to laugh; A time to mourn, And a time to dance;
5 A time to cast away stones, And a time to gather stones; A time to embrace, And a time to refrain from embracing;
6 A time to gain, And a time to lose; A time to keep, And a time to throw away;
7 A time to tear, And a time to sew; A time to keep silence, And a time to speak;
8 A time to love, And a time to hate; A time of war, And a time of peace.
<br><font color="#999999">The God-Given Task</font><br><br>9 What profit has the worker from that in which he labors?
10 I have seen the God-given task with which the sons of men are to be occupied.
11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end.
12 I know that nothing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their lives,
13 and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor — it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the gift of God.
14 I know that whatever God does, It shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, And nothing taken from it. God does <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> that men should fear before Him.
15 That which is has already been, And what is to be has already been; And God requires an account of what is past.
<br><font color="#999999">Injustice Seems to Prevail</font><br><br>16 Moreover I saw under the sun: <font color="#999999"><em>In</em></font> the place of judgment, Wickedness <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> there; And <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> the place of righteousness, Iniquity <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> there.
17 I said in my heart, “God shall judge the righteous and the wicked, For <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> a time there for every purpose and for every work.”
18 I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> animals.”
19 For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.
20 All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust.
21 Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?
22 So I perceived that nothing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his heritage. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Uselessness of Selfish Toil</font><br><br>1 Then I returned and considered all the oppression that is done under the sun: And look! The tears of the oppressed, But they have no comforter — On the side of their oppressors <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> power, But they have no comforter.
2 Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead, More than the living who are still alive.
3 Yet, better than both <font color="#999999"><em>is he</em></font> who has never existed, Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
<br><font color="#999999">The Vanity of Selfish Toil</font><br><br>4 Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind.
5 The fool folds his hands And consumes his own flesh.
6 Better a handful <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> quietness Than both hands full, <font color="#999999"><em>together with</em></font> toil and grasping for the wind.
7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:
8 There is one alone, without companion: He has neither son nor brother. Yet <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no end to all his labors, Nor is his eye satisfied with riches. <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>he never asks,</em></font> “For whom do I toil and deprive myself of good?” This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and a grave misfortune.
<br><font color="#999999">The Value of a Friend</font><br><br>9 Two <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> better than one, Because they have a good reward for their labor.
10 For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> alone when he falls, For <font color="#999999"><em>he has</em></font> no one to help him up.
11 Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; But how can one be warm <font color="#999999"><em>alone?</em></font>
12 Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
<br><font color="#999999">Popularity Passes Away</font><br><br>13 Better a poor and wise youth Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more.
14 For he comes out of prison to be king, Although he was born poor in his kingdom.
15 I saw all the living who walk under the sun; They were with the second youth who stands in his place.
16 <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> no end of all the people over whom he was made king; Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him. Surely this also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Fear God, Keep Your Vows</font><br><br>1 Walk prudently when you go to the house of God; and draw near to hear rather than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil.
2 Do not be rash with your mouth, And let not your heart utter anything hastily before God. For God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in heaven, and you on earth; Therefore let your words be few.
3 For a dream comes through much activity, And a fool’s voice <font color="#999999"><em>is known</em></font> by <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> many words.
4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it; For <font color="#999999"><em>He has</em></font> no pleasure in fools. Pay what you have vowed —
5 Better not to vow than to vow and not pay.
6 Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, nor say before the messenger <font color="#999999"><em>of God</em></font> that it <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> an error. Why should God be angry at your excuse and destroy the work of your hands?
7 For in the multitude of dreams and many words <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> also vanity. But fear God.
<br><font color="#999999">The Vanity of Gain and Honor</font><br><br>8 If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice and righteousness in a province, do not marvel at the matter; for high official watches over high official, and higher officials are over them.
9 Moreover the profit of the land is for all; <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> the king is served from the field.
10 He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver; Nor he who loves abundance, with increase. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.
11 When goods increase, They increase who eat them; So what profit have the owners Except to see <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> with their eyes?
12 The sleep of a laboring man <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> sweet, Whether he eats little or much; But the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep.
13 There is a severe evil <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> I have seen under the sun: Riches kept for their owner to his hurt.
14 But those riches perish through misfortune; When he begets a son, <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> nothing in his hand.
15 As he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return, To go as he came; And he shall take nothing from his labor Which he may carry away in his hand.
16 And this also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a severe evil — Just exactly as he came, so shall he go. And what profit has he who has labored for the wind?
17 All his days he also eats in darkness, And <font color="#999999"><em>he has</em></font> much sorrow and sickness and anger.
18 Here is what I have seen: <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> good and fitting <font color="#999999"><em>for one</em></font> to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him; for it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his heritage.
19 As for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor — this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the gift of God.
20 For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> busy with the joy of his heart.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Wealth Is Not the Goal of Life</font><br><br>1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> common among men:
2 A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires; yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity, and it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an evil affliction.
3 If a man begets a hundred <font color="#999999"><em>children</em></font> and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed he has no burial, I say <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> a stillborn child <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than he —
4 for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.
5 Though it has not seen the sun or known <font color="#999999"><em>anything,</em></font> this has more rest than that man,
6 even if he lives a thousand years twice — but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one place?
7 All the labor of man <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for his mouth, And yet the soul is not satisfied.
8 For what more has the wise <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> than the fool? What does the poor man have, Who knows <font color="#999999"><em>how</em></font> to walk before the living?
9 Better <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity and grasping for the wind.
10 Whatever one is, he has been named already, For it is known that he <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> man; And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.
11 Since there are many things that increase vanity, How <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> man the better?
12 For who knows what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Value of Practical Wisdom</font><br><br>1 A good name <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than precious ointment, And the day of death than the day of one’s birth;
2 Better to go to the house of mourning Than to go to the house of feasting, For that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the end of all men; And the living will take <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> to heart.
3 Sorrow <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than laughter, For by a sad countenance the heart is made better.
4 The heart of the wise <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the house of mourning, But the heart of fools <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the house of mirth.
5 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> better to hear the rebuke of the wise Than for a man to hear the song of fools.
6 For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, So <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.
7 Surely oppression destroys a wise <font color="#999999"><em>man’s</em></font> reason, And a bribe debases the heart.
8 The end of a thing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than its beginning; The patient in spirit <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than the proud in spirit.
9 Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools.
10 Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For you do not inquire wisely concerning this.
11 Wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good with an inheritance, And profitable to those who see the sun.
12 For wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a defense <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> money <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a defense, But the excellence of knowledge <font color="#999999"><em>is that</em></font> wisdom gives life to those who have it.
13 Consider the work of God; For who can make straight what He has made crooked?
14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, But in the day of adversity consider: Surely God has appointed the one as well as the other, So that man can find out nothing <font color="#999999"><em>that will come</em></font> after him.
15 I have seen everything in my days of vanity: There is a just <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> who perishes in his righteousness, And there is a wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> who prolongs <font color="#999999"><em>life</em></font> in his wickedness.
16 Do not be overly righteous, Nor be overly wise: Why should you destroy yourself?
17 Do not be overly wicked, Nor be foolish: Why should you die before your time?
18 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> good that you grasp this, And also not remove your hand from the other; For he who fears God will escape them all.
19 Wisdom strengthens the wise More than ten rulers of the city.
20 For <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> not a just man on earth who does good And does not sin.
21 Also do not take to heart everything people say, Lest you hear your servant cursing you.
22 For many times, also, your own heart has known That even you have cursed others.
23 All this I have proved by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise”; But it <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> far from me.
24 As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep, Who can find it out?
25 I applied my heart to know, To search and seek out wisdom and the reason <font color="#999999"><em>of things,</em></font> To know the wickedness of folly, Even of foolishness <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> madness.
26 And I find more bitter than death The woman whose heart <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> snares and nets, Whose hands <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> fetters. He who pleases God shall escape from her, But the sinner shall be trapped by her.
27 “Here is what I have found,” says the Preacher, “<font color="#999999"><em>Adding</em></font> one thing to the other to find out the reason,
28 Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find: One man among a thousand I have found, But a woman among all these I have not found.
29 Truly, this only I have found: That God made man upright, But they have sought out many schemes.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Obey Authorities for God’s Sake</font><br><br>1 Who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like a wise <font color="#999999"><em>man?</em></font> And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, And the sternness of his face is changed.
<br><font color="#999999">Obey Authorities for God’s Sake</font><br><br>2 I <font color="#999999"><em>say,</em></font> “Keep the king’s commandment for the sake of your oath to God.
3 Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.”
4 Where the word of a king <font color="#999999"><em>is, there is</em></font> power; And who may say to him, “What are you doing?”
5 He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful; And a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment,
6 Because for every matter there is a time and judgment, Though the misery of man increases greatly.
7 For he does not know what will happen; So who can tell him when it will occur?
8 No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit, And no one has power in the day of death. <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> no release from that war, And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.
9 All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.
<br><font color="#999999">Death Comes to All</font><br><br>10 Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.
11 Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
12 Though a sinner does evil a hundred <font color="#999999"><em>times,</em></font> and his <font color="#999999"><em>days</em></font> are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him.
13 But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> days, <font color="#999999"><em>which are</em></font> as a shadow, because he does not fear before God.
14 There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.
15 So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor <font color="#999999"><em>all</em></font> the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.
16 When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night,
17 then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> yet he will not find <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> moreover, though a wise <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> attempts to know <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> he will not be able to find <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>

<br><font color="#999999">Death Comes to All</font><br><br>1 For I considered all this in my heart, so that I could declare it all: that the righteous and the wise and their works <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in the hand of God. People know neither love nor hatred <font color="#999999"><em>by</em></font> anything <font color="#999999"><em>they see</em></font> before them.
2 All things <font color="#999999"><em>come</em></font> alike to all: One event <font color="#999999"><em>happens</em></font> to the righteous and the wicked; To the good, the clean, and the unclean; To him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the sinner; He who takes an oath as <font color="#999999"><em>he</em></font> who fears an oath.
3 This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one thing <font color="#999999"><em>happens</em></font> to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; madness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in their hearts while they live, and after that <font color="#999999"><em>they go</em></font> to the dead.
4 But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
5 For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten.
6 Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun.
7 Go, eat your bread with joy, And drink your wine with a merry heart; For God has already accepted your works.
8 Let your garments always be white, And let your head lack no oil.
9 Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; for that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your portion in life, and in the labor which you perform under the sun.
10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with your might; for <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.
11 I returned and saw under the sun that — The race <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not to the swift, Nor the battle to the strong, Nor bread to the wise, Nor riches to men of understanding, Nor favor to men of skill; But time and chance happen to them all.
12 For man also does not know his time: Like fish taken in a cruel net, Like birds caught in a snare, So the sons of men <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> snared in an evil time, When it falls suddenly upon them.
<br><font color="#999999">Wisdom Superior to Folly</font><br><br>13 This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it <font color="#999999"><em>seemed</em></font> great to me:
14 <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great snares around it.
15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man.
16 Then I said: “Wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> despised, And his words are not heard.
17 Words of the wise, <font color="#999999"><em>spoken</em></font> quietly, <font color="#999999"><em>should be</em></font> heard Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools.
18 Wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than weapons of war; But one sinner destroys much good.”

<br><font color="#999999">Wisdom and Folly</font><br><br>1 Dead flies putrefy the perfumer’s ointment, And cause it to give off a foul odor; <font color="#999999"><em>So does</em></font> a little folly to one respected for wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> honor.
2 A wise man’s heart <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> at his right hand, But a fool’s heart at his left.
3 Even when a fool walks along the way, He lacks wisdom, And he shows everyone <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> he <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a fool.
4 If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, Do not leave your post; For conciliation pacifies great offenses.
5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, As an error proceeding from the ruler:
6 Folly is set in great dignity, While the rich sit in a lowly place.
7 I have seen servants on horses, While princes walk on the ground like servants.
8 He who digs a pit will fall into it, And whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.
9 He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> he who splits wood may be endangered by it.
10 If the ax is dull, And one does not sharpen the edge, Then he must use more strength; But wisdom brings success.
11 A serpent may bite when <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> not charmed; The babbler is no different.
12 The words of a wise man’s mouth <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> gracious, But the lips of a fool shall swallow him up;
13 The words of his mouth begin with foolishness, And the end of his talk <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> raving madness.
14 A fool also multiplies words. No man knows what is to be; Who can tell him what will be after him?
15 The labor of fools wearies them, For they do not even know how to go to the city!
16 Woe to you, O land, when your king <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a child, And your princes feast in the morning!
17 Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> you, O land, when your king <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the son of nobles, And your princes feast at the proper time — For strength and not for drunkenness!
18 Because of laziness the building decays, And through idleness of hands the house leaks.
19 A feast is made for laughter, And wine makes merry; But money answers everything.
20 Do not curse the king, even in your thought; Do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom; For a bird of the air may carry your voice, And a bird in flight may tell the matter.

<br><font color="#999999">The Value of Diligence</font><br><br>1 Cast your bread upon the waters, For you will find it after many days.
2 Give a serving to seven, and also to eight, For you do not know what evil will be on the earth.
3 If the clouds are full of rain, They empty <font color="#999999"><em>themselves</em></font> upon the earth; And if a tree falls to the south or the north, In the place where the tree falls, there it shall lie.
4 He who observes the wind will not sow, And he who regards the clouds will not reap.
5 As you do not know what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the way of the wind, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> how the bones <font color="#999999"><em>grow</em></font> in the womb of her who is with child, So you do not know the works of God who makes everything.
6 In the morning sow your seed, And in the evening do not withhold your hand; For you do not know which will prosper, Either this or that, Or whether both alike <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> good.
7 Truly the light is sweet, And <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> pleasant for the eyes to behold the sun;
8 But if a man lives many years <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> rejoices in them all, Yet let him remember the days of darkness, For they will be many. All that is coming <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.
<br><font color="#999999">Seek God in Early Life</font><br><br>9 Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, And let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth; Walk in the ways of your heart, And in the sight of your eyes; But know that for all these God will bring you into judgment.
10 Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, And put away evil from your flesh, For childhood and youth <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> vanity.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Seek God in Early Life</font><br><br>1 Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, Before the difficult days come, And the years draw near when you say, “I have no pleasure in them”:
2 While the sun and the light, The moon and the stars, Are not darkened, And the clouds do not return after the rain;
3 In the day when the keepers of the house tremble, And the strong men bow down; When the grinders cease because they are few, And those that look through the windows grow dim;
4 When the doors are shut in the streets, And the sound of grinding is low; When one rises up at the sound of a bird, And all the daughters of music are brought low.
5 Also they are afraid of height, And of terrors in the way; When the almond tree blossoms, The grasshopper is a burden, And desire fails. For man goes to his eternal home, And the mourners go about the streets.
6 <font color="#999999"><em>Remember your Creator</em></font> before the silver cord is loosed, Or the golden bowl is broken, Or the pitcher shattered at the fountain, Or the wheel broken at the well.
7 Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it.
8 “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher, “All <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> vanity.”
<br><font color="#999999">The Whole Duty of Man</font><br><br>9 And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yes, he pondered and sought out <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> set in order many proverbs.
10 The Preacher sought to find acceptable words; and <font color="#999999"><em>what was</em></font> written <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> upright — words of truth.
11 The words of the wise are like goads, and the words of scholars are like well-driven nails, given by one Shepherd.
12 And further, my son, be admonished by these. Of making many books <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no end, and much study <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wearisome to the flesh.
13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, For this is man’s all.
14 For God will bring every work into judgment, Including every secret thing, Whether good or evil.
