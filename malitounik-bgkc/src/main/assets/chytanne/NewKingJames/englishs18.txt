<br><font color="#999999">Job and His Family in Uz</font><br><br>1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil.
2 And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
3 Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.
4 And his sons would go and feast <font color="#999999"><em>in their</em></font> houses, each on his <font color="#999999"><em>appointed</em></font> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
5 So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <font color="#999999"><em>according to</em></font> the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly.
<br><font color="#999999">Satan Attacks Job’s Character</font><br><br>6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.
7 And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” So Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”
8 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”
9 So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
10 Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
11 But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”
12 And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in your power; only do not lay a hand on his <font color="#999999"><em>person.</em></font>” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.
<br><font color="#999999">Job Loses His Property and Children</font><br><br>13 Now there was a day when his sons and daughters <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house;
14 and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
15 when the Sabeans raided <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> and took them away — indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
16 While he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
17 While he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
18 While he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
19 and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
20 Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped.
21 And he said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, And naked shall I return there. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord.”
22 In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Satan Attacks Job’s Health</font><br><br>1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.
2 And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”
3 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”
4 So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.
5 But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”
6 And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in your hand, but spare his life.”
7 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
8 And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.
9 Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”
10 But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
<br><font color="#999999">Job’s Three Friends</font><br><br>11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place — Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him.
12 And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven.
13 So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> grief was very great.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Job Deplores His Birth</font><br><br>1 After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his <font color="#999999"><em>birth.</em></font>
2 And Job spoke, and said:
3 “May the day perish on which I was born, And the night <font color="#999999"><em>in which</em></font> it was said, ‘A male child is conceived.’
4 May that day be darkness; May God above not seek it, Nor the light shine upon it.
5 May darkness and the shadow of death claim it; May a cloud settle on it; May the blackness of the day terrify it.
6 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> that night, may darkness seize it; May it not rejoice among the days of the year, May it not come into the number of the months.
7 Oh, may that night be barren! May no joyful shout come into it!
8 May those curse it who curse the day, Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan.
9 May the stars of its morning be dark; May it look for light, but <font color="#999999"><em>have</em></font> none, And not see the dawning of the day;
10 Because it did not shut up the doors of my <font color="#999999"><em>mother’s</em></font> womb, Nor hide sorrow from my eyes.
11 “Why did I not die at birth? <font color="#999999"><em>Why</em></font> did I <font color="#999999"><em>not</em></font> perish when I came from the womb?
12 Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?
13 For now I would have lain still and been quiet, I would have been asleep; Then I would have been at rest
14 With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built ruins for themselves,
15 Or with princes who had gold, Who filled their houses <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> silver;
16 Or <font color="#999999"><em>why</em></font> was I not hidden like a stillborn child, Like infants who never saw light?
17 There the wicked cease <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> troubling, And there the weary are at rest.
18 <font color="#999999"><em>There</em></font> the prisoners rest together; They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
19 The small and great are there, And the servant <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> free from his master.
20 “Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter of soul,
21 Who long for death, but it does not <font color="#999999"><em>come,</em></font> And search for it more than hidden treasures;
22 Who rejoice exceedingly, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> are glad when they can find the grave?
23 <font color="#999999"><em>Why is light given</em></font> to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?
24 For my sighing comes before I eat, And my groanings pour out like water.
25 For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me.
26 I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for trouble comes.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Eliphaz: Job Has Sinned</font><br><br>1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2 “<font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking?
3 Surely you have instructed many, And you have strengthened weak hands.
4 Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, And you have strengthened the feeble knees;
5 But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; It touches you, and you are troubled.
6 <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?
7 “Remember now, who <font color="#999999"><em>ever</em></font> perished being innocent? Or where were the upright <font color="#999999"><em>ever</em></font> cut off?
8 Even as I have seen, Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same.
9 By the blast of God they perish, And by the breath of His anger they are consumed.
10 The roaring of the lion, The voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken.
11 The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
12 “Now a word was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it.
13 In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,
14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones shake.
15 Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair on my body stood up.
16 It stood still, But I could not discern its appearance. A form <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> before my eyes; <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> silence; Then I heard a voice <font color="#999999"><em>saying:</em></font>
17 ‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
18 If He puts no trust in His servants, <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> He charges His angels with error,
19 How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> are crushed before a moth?
20 They are broken in pieces from morning till evening; They perish forever, with no one regarding.
21 Does not their own excellence go away? They die, even without wisdom.’

===
<br><font color="#999999">Eliphaz: Job Is Chastened by God</font><br><br>1 “Call out now; Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
2 For wrath kills a foolish man, And envy slays a simple one.
3 I have seen the foolish taking root, But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.
4 His sons are far from safety, They are crushed in the gate, And <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no deliverer.
5 Because the hungry eat up his harvest, Taking it even from the thorns, And a snare snatches their <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[c]</i></span>substance.
6 For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble spring from the ground;
7 Yet man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward.
8 “But as for me, I would seek God, And to God I would commit my cause —
9 Who does great things, and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number.
10 He gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields.
11 He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety.
12 He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot carry out their plans.
13 He catches the wise in their own craftiness, And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them.
14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noontime as in the night.
15 But He saves the needy from the sword, From the mouth of the mighty, And from their hand.
16 So the poor have hope, And injustice shuts her mouth.
17 “Behold, happy <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the man whom God corrects; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
18 For He bruises, but He binds up; He wounds, but His hands make whole.
19 He shall deliver you in six troubles, Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.
20 In famine He shall redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword.
21 You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
22 You shall laugh at destruction and famine, And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
23 For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
24 You shall know that your tent <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in peace; You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.
25 You shall also know that your descendants <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> many, And your offspring like the grass of the earth.
26 You shall come to the grave at a full age, As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season.
27 Behold, this we have searched out; It <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> true. Hear it, and know for yourself.”

<br><font color="#999999">Job: My Complaint Is Just</font><br><br>1 Then Job answered and said:
2 “Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, And my calamity laid with it on the scales!
3 For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea — Therefore my words have been rash.
4 For the arrows of the Almighty <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> within me; My spirit drinks in their poison; The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
5 Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass, Or does the ox low over its fodder?
6 Can flavorless food be eaten without salt? Or is there <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> taste in the white of an egg?
7 My soul refuses to touch them; They <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> as loathsome food to me.
8 “Oh, that I might have my request, That God would grant <font color="#999999"><em>me</em></font> the thing that I long for!
9 That it would please God to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off!
10 Then I would still have comfort; Though in anguish I would exult, He will not spare; For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
11 “What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> my end, that I should prolong my life?
12 <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?
13 <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> my help not within me? And is success driven from me?
14 “To him who is afflicted, kindness <font color="#999999"><em>should be shown</em></font> by his friend, Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
15 My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook, Like the streams of the brooks that pass away,
16 Which are dark because of the ice, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> into which the snow vanishes.
17 When it is warm, they cease to flow; When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
18 The paths of their way turn aside, They go nowhere and perish.
19 The caravans of Tema look, The travelers of Sheba hope for them.
20 They are disappointed because they were confident; They come there and are confused.
21 For now you are nothing, You see terror and are afraid.
22 Did I ever say, ‘Bring <font color="#999999"><em>something</em></font> to me’? Or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’?
23 Or, ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s hand’? Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of oppressors’?
24 “Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
25 How forceful are right words! But what does your arguing prove?
26 Do you intend to rebuke <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> words, And the speeches of a desperate one, <font color="#999999"><em>which are</em></font> as wind?
27 Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless, And you undermine your friend.
28 Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; For I would never lie to your face.
29 Yield now, let there be no injustice! Yes, concede, my righteousness still stands!
30 Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern the unsavory?

<br><font color="#999999">Job: My Suffering Is Comfortless</font><br><br>1 “<font color="#999999"><em>Is there</em></font> not a time of hard service for man on earth? <font color="#999999"><em>Are not</em></font> his days also like the days of a hired man?
2 Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade, And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages,
3 So I have been allotted months of futility, And wearisome nights have been appointed to me.
4 When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, And the night be ended?’ For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn.
5 My flesh is caked with worms and dust, My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh.
6 “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope.
7 Oh, remember that my life <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a breath! My eye will never again see good.
8 The eye of him who sees me will see me no <font color="#999999"><em>more;</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>While</em></font> your eyes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> upon me, I shall no longer <font color="#999999"><em>be.</em></font>
9 <font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> the cloud disappears and vanishes away, So he who goes down to the grave does not come up.
10 He shall never return to his house, Nor shall his place know him anymore.
11 “Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
12 <font color="#999999"><em>Am</em></font> I a sea, or a sea serpent, That You set a guard over me?
13 When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,’
14 Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions,
15 So that my soul chooses strangling <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> death rather than my body.
16 I loathe <font color="#999999"><em>my life;</em></font> I would not live forever. Let me alone, For my days <font color="#999999"><em>are but</em></font> a breath.
17 “What <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> man, that You should exalt him, <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> You should set Your heart on him,
18 That You should visit him every morning, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> test him every moment?
19 How long? Will You not look away from me, And let me alone till I swallow my saliva?
20 Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself?
21 Why then do You not pardon my transgression, And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, And You will seek me diligently, But I <font color="#999999"><em>will</em></font> no longer <font color="#999999"><em>be.</em></font>”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Bildad: Job Should Repent</font><br><br>1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2 “How long will you speak these <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> And the words of your mouth <font color="#999999"><em>be like</em></font> a strong wind?
3 Does God subvert judgment? Or does the Almighty pervert justice?
4 If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression.
5 If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplication to the Almighty,
6 If you <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> pure and upright, Surely now He would awake for you, And prosper your rightful dwelling place.
7 Though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would increase abundantly.
8 “For inquire, please, of the former age, And consider the things discovered by their fathers;
9 For we <font color="#999999"><em>were born</em></font> yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days on earth <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a shadow.
10 Will they not teach you and tell you, And utter words from their heart?
11 “Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds flourish without water?
12 While it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> yet green <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> not cut down, It withers before any <font color="#999999"><em>other</em></font> plant.
13 So <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish,
14 Whose confidence shall be cut off, And whose trust <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a spider’s web.
15 He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not endure.
16 He grows green in the sun, And his branches spread out in his garden.
17 His roots wrap around the rock heap, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> look for a place in the stones.
18 If he is destroyed from his place, Then <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> will deny him, <font color="#999999"><em>saying,</em></font> ‘I have not seen you.’
19 “Behold, this is the joy of His way, And out of the earth others will grow.
20 Behold, God will not cast away the blameless, Nor will He uphold the evildoers.
21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughing, And your lips with rejoicing.
22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing.”

<br><font color="#999999">Job: There Is No Mediator</font><br><br>1 Then Job answered and said:
2 “Truly I know <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> so, But how can a man be righteous before God?
3 If one wished to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
4 <font color="#999999"><em>God is</em></font> wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened <font color="#999999"><em>himself</em></font> against Him and prospered?
5 He removes the mountains, and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger;
6 He shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;
7 He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals off the stars;
8 He alone spreads out the heavens, And treads on the waves of the sea;
9 He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;
10 He does great things past finding out, Yes, wonders without number.
11 If He goes by me, I do not see <font color="#999999"><em>Him;</em></font> If He moves past, I do not perceive Him;
12 If He takes away, who can hinder Him? Who can say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’
13 God will not withdraw His anger, The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.
14 “How then can I answer Him, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> choose my words <font color="#999999"><em>to reason</em></font> with Him?
15 For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge.
16 If I called and He answered me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.
17 For He crushes me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause.
18 He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with bitterness.
19 If <font color="#999999"><em>it is a matter</em></font> of strength, indeed <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> strong; And if of justice, who will appoint my day <font color="#999999"><em>in court?</em></font>
20 Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; Though I <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> blameless, it would prove me perverse.
21 “I am blameless, yet I do not know myself; I despise my life.
22 It <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> all one <font color="#999999"><em>thing;</em></font> Therefore I say, ‘He destroys the blameless and the wicked.’
23 If the scourge slays suddenly, He laughs at the plight of the innocent.
24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not <font color="#999999"><em>He,</em></font> who else could it be?
25 “Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.
26 They pass by like swift ships, Like an eagle swooping on its prey.
27 If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,’
28 I am afraid of all my sufferings; I know that You will not hold me innocent.
29 <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> I am condemned, Why then do I labor in vain?
30 If I wash myself with snow water, And cleanse my hands with soap,
31 Yet You will plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes will abhor me.
32 “For <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> not a man, as I <font color="#999999"><em>am,</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> I may answer Him, <font color="#999999"><em>And that</em></font> we should go to court together.
33 Nor is there any mediator between us, <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> may lay his hand on us both.
34 Let Him take His rod away from me, And do not let dread of Him terrify me.
35 <font color="#999999"><em>Then</em></font> I would speak and not fear Him, But it is not so with me.

<br><font color="#999999">Job: I Would Plead with God</font><br><br>1 “My soul loathes my life; I will give free course to my complaint, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

8 ‘Your hands have made me and fashioned me, An intricate unity; Yet You would destroy me.
9 Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again?
10 Did You not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese,

18 ‘Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!
19 I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.

2 “Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be vindicated?
3 Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one rebuke you?
4 For you have said, ‘My doctrine <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> pure, And I am clean in your eyes.’
5 But oh, that God would speak, And open His lips against you,

12 For an empty-headed man will be wise, When a wild donkey’s colt is born a man.
13 “If you would prepare your heart, And stretch out your hands toward Him;
14 If iniquity <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in your hand, <font color="#999999"><em>and you</em></font> put it far away, And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents;

4 “I am one mocked by his friends, Who called on God, and He answered him, The just and blameless <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> ridiculed.

17 He leads counselors away plundered, And makes fools of the judges.
18 He loosens the bonds of kings, And binds their waist with a belt.
19 He leads princes away plundered, And overthrows the mighty.
20 He deprives the trusted ones of speech, And takes away the discernment of the elders.
21 He pours contempt on princes, And disarms the mighty.
22 He uncovers deep things out of darkness, And brings the shadow of death to light.
23 He makes nations great, and destroys them; He enlarges nations, and guides them.
24 He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth, And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness.

8 Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God?
9 Will it be well when He searches you out? Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man?
10 He will surely rebuke you If you secretly show partiality.
11 Will not His excellence make you afraid, And the dread of Him fall upon you?
12 Your platitudes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.

4 Who can bring a clean <font color="#999999"><em>thing</em></font> out of an unclean? No one!
5 Since his days <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> determined, The number of his months <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass.

8 Though its root may grow old in the earth, And its stump may die in the ground,
9 <font color="#999999"><em>Yet</em></font> at the scent of water it will bud And bring forth branches like a plant.

4 Yes, you cast off fear, And restrain prayer before God.

31 Let him not trust in futile <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> deceiving himself, For futility will be his reward.
32 It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green.

<br><font color="#999999">Zophar’s Sermon on the Wicked Man</font><br><br>1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2 “Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer, Because of the turmoil within me.
3 I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me, And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.
4 “Do you <font color="#999999"><em>not</em></font> know this of old, Since man was placed on earth,
5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the hypocrite is <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> for a moment?
6 Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, And his head reaches to the clouds,
7 <font color="#999999"><em>Yet</em></font> he will perish forever like his own refuse; Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
8 He will fly away like a dream, and not be found; Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
9 The eye <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> saw him will <font color="#999999"><em>see him</em></font> no more, Nor will his place behold him anymore.
10 His children will seek the favor of the poor, And his hands will restore his wealth.
11 His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it will lie down with him in the dust.
12 “Though evil is sweet in his mouth, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> he hides it under his tongue,
13 <font color="#999999"><em>Though</em></font> he spares it and does not forsake it, But still keeps it in his mouth,
14 <font color="#999999"><em>Yet</em></font> his food in his stomach turns sour; It becomes cobra venom within him.
15 He swallows down riches And vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly.
16 He will suck the poison of cobras; The viper’s tongue will slay him.
17 He will not see the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18 He will restore that for which he labored, And will not swallow <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> down; From the proceeds of business He will get no enjoyment.
19 For he has oppressed <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> forsaken the poor, He has violently seized a house which he did not build.
20 “Because he knows no quietness in his heart, He will not save anything he desires.
21 Nothing is left for him to eat; Therefore his well-being will not last.
22 In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress; Every hand of misery will come against him.
23 <font color="#999999"><em>When</em></font> he is about to fill his stomach, <font color="#999999"><em>God</em></font> will cast on him the fury of His wrath, And will rain <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> on him while he is eating.
24 He will flee from the iron weapon; A bronze bow will pierce him through.
25 It is drawn, and comes out of the body; Yes, the glittering <font color="#999999"><em>point comes</em></font> out of his gall. Terrors <font color="#999999"><em>come</em></font> upon him;
26 Total darkness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> reserved for his treasures. An unfanned fire will consume him; It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent.
27 The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him.
28 The increase of his house will depart, <font color="#999999"><em>And his goods</em></font> will flow away in the day of His wrath.
29 This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the portion from God for a wicked man, The heritage appointed to him by God.”

<br><font color="#999999">Job’s Discourse on the Wicked</font><br><br>1 Then Job answered and said:
2 “Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your consolation.
3 Bear with me that I may speak, And after I have spoken, keep mocking.
4 “As for me, <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> my complaint against man? And if <font color="#999999"><em>it were,</em></font> why should I not be impatient?
5 Look at me and be astonished; Put <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> hand over <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> mouth.
6 Even when I remember I am terrified, And trembling takes hold of my flesh.
7 Why do the wicked live <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> become old, Yes, become mighty in power?
8 Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.
9 Their houses <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> safe from fear, Neither <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the rod of God upon them.
10 Their bull breeds without failure; Their cow calves without miscarriage.
11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.
12 They sing to the tambourine and harp, And rejoice to the sound of the flute.
13 They spend their days in wealth, And in a moment go down to the grave.
14 Yet they say to God, ‘Depart from us, For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.
15 Who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?’
16 Indeed their prosperity <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
17 “How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? <font color="#999999"><em>How often</em></font> does their destruction come upon them, The sorrows <font color="#999999"><em>God</em></font> distributes in His anger?
18 They are like straw before the wind, And like chaff that a storm carries away.
19 <font color="#999999"><em>They say,</em></font> ‘God lays up one’s iniquity for his children’; Let Him recompense him, that he may know <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
20 Let his eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
21 For what does he care about his household after him, When the number of his months is cut in half?
22 “Can <font color="#999999"><em>anyone</em></font> teach God knowledge, Since He judges those on high?
23 One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and secure;
24 His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moist.
25 Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, Never having eaten with pleasure.
26 They lie down alike in the dust, And worms cover them.
27 “Look, I know your thoughts, And the schemes <font color="#999999"><em>with which</em></font> you would wrong me.
28 For you say, ‘Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the house of the prince? And where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the tent, The dwelling place of the wicked?’
29 Have you not asked those who travel the road? And do you not know their signs?
30 For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom; They shall be brought out on the day of wrath.
31 Who condemns his way to his face? And who repays him <font color="#999999"><em>for what</em></font> he has done?
32 Yet he shall be brought to the grave, And a vigil kept over the tomb.
33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; Everyone shall follow him, As countless <font color="#999999"><em>have gone</em></font> before him.
34 How then can you comfort me with empty words, Since falsehood remains in your answers?”

<br><font color="#999999">Eliphaz Accuses Job of Wickedness</font><br><br>1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2 “Can a man be profitable to God, Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself?
3 <font color="#999999"><em>Is it</em></font> any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or <font color="#999999"><em>is it</em></font> gain <font color="#999999"><em>to Him</em></font> that you make your ways blameless?
4 “Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you, And enters into judgment with you?
5 <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> not your wickedness great, And your iniquity without end?
6 For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason, And stripped the naked of their clothing.
7 You have not given the weary water to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry.
8 But the mighty man possessed the land, And the honorable man dwelt in it.
9 You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
10 Therefore snares <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you, And sudden fear troubles you,
11 Or darkness <font color="#999999"><em>so that</em></font> you cannot see; And an abundance of water covers you.
12 “Is not God in the height of heaven? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!
13 And you say, ‘What does God know? Can He judge through the deep darkness?
14 Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see, And He walks above the circle of heaven.’
15 Will you keep to the old way Which wicked men have trod,
16 Who were cut down before their time, Whose foundations were swept away by a flood?
17 They said to God, ‘Depart from us! What can the Almighty do to them?’
18 Yet He filled their houses with good <font color="#999999"><em>things;</em></font> But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
19 “The righteous see <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> and are glad, And the innocent laugh at them:
20 ‘Surely our adversaries are cut down, And the fire consumes their remnant.’
21 “Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace; Thereby good will come to you.
22 Receive, please, instruction from His mouth, And lay up His words in your heart.
23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up; You will remove iniquity far from your tents.
24 Then you will lay your gold in the dust, And the <font color="#999999"><em>gold</em></font> of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.
25 Yes, the Almighty will be your gold And your precious silver;
26 For then you will have your delight in the Almighty, And lift up your face to God.
27 You will make your prayer to Him, He will hear you, And you will pay your vows.
28 You will also declare a thing, And it will be established for you; So light will shine on your ways.
29 When they cast <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> down, and you say, ‘Exaltation <font color="#999999"><em>will come!</em></font>’ Then He will save the humble <font color="#999999"><em>person.</em></font>
30 He will <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> deliver one who is not innocent; Yes, he will be delivered by the purity of your hands.”

<br><font color="#999999">Job Proclaims God’s Righteous Judgments</font><br><br>1 Then Job answered and said:
2 “Even today my complaint is bitter; My hand is listless because of my groaning.
3 Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> I might come to His seat!
4 I would present <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> case before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I would know the words <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> He would answer me, And understand what He would say to me.
6 Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would take <font color="#999999"><em>note</em></font> of me.
7 There the upright could reason with Him, And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
8 “Look, I go forward, but He is not <font color="#999999"><em>there,</em></font> And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
9 When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold <font color="#999999"><em>Him;</em></font> When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see <font color="#999999"><em>Him.</em></font>
10 But He knows the way that I take; <font color="#999999"><em>When</em></font> He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.
11 My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside.
12 I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary <font color="#999999"><em>food.</em></font>
13 “But He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> unique, and who can make Him change? And <font color="#999999"><em>whatever</em></font> His soul desires, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> He does.
14 For He performs <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> appointed for me, And many such <font color="#999999"><em>things are</em></font> with Him.
15 Therefore I am terrified at His presence; When I consider <font color="#999999"><em>this,</em></font> I am afraid of Him.
16 For God made my heart weak, And the Almighty terrifies me;
17 Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness, And He did <font color="#999999"><em>not</em></font> hide deep darkness from my face.

<br><font color="#999999">Job Complains of Violence on the Earth</font><br><br>1 “<font color="#999999"><em>Since</em></font> times are not hidden from the Almighty, Why do those who know Him see not His days?
2 “<font color="#999999"><em>Some</em></font> remove landmarks; They seize flocks violently and feed <font color="#999999"><em>on them;</em></font>
3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
4 They push the needy off the road; All the poor of the land are forced to hide.
5 Indeed, <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> wild donkeys in the desert, They go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness <font color="#999999"><em>yields</em></font> food for them <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> for <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> children.
6 They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
7 They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.
8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And huddle around the rock for want of shelter.
9 “<font color="#999999"><em>Some</em></font> snatch the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge from the poor.
10 They cause <font color="#999999"><em>the poor</em></font> to go naked, without clothing; And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
11 They press out oil within their walls, And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
12 The dying groan in the city, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not charge <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> with wrong.
13 “There are those who rebel against the light; They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths.
14 The murderer rises with the light; He kills the poor and needy; And in the night he is like a thief.
15 The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, ‘No eye will see me’; And he disguises <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> face.
16 In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the daytime; They do not know the light.
17 For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death; If <font color="#999999"><em>someone</em></font> recognizes <font color="#999999"><em>them,</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>They are in</em></font> the terrors of the shadow of death.
18 “They <font color="#999999"><em>should be</em></font> swift on the face of the waters, Their portion <font color="#999999"><em>should be</em></font> cursed in the earth, <font color="#999999"><em>So that</em></font> no <font color="#999999"><em>one would</em></font> turn into the way of their vineyards.
19 As drought and heat consume the snow waters, <font color="#999999"><em>So</em></font> the grave <font color="#999999"><em>consumes those who</em></font> have sinned.
20 The womb <font color="#999999"><em>should</em></font> forget him, The worm <font color="#999999"><em>should</em></font> feed sweetly on him; He <font color="#999999"><em>should</em></font> be remembered no more, And wickedness <font color="#999999"><em>should</em></font> be broken like a tree.
21 For he preys on the barren <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> do not bear, And does no good for the widow.
22 “But <font color="#999999"><em>God</em></font> draws the mighty away with His power; He rises up, but no <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> is sure of life.
23 He gives them security, and they rely <font color="#999999"><em>on it;</em></font> Yet His eyes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> on their ways.
24 They are exalted for a little while, Then they are gone. They are brought low; They are taken out of the way like all <font color="#999999"><em>others;</em></font> They dry out like the heads of grain.

9 He covers the face of <font color="#999999"><em>His</em></font> throne, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> spreads His cloud over it.
10 He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters, At the boundary of light and darkness.
11 The pillars of heaven tremble, And are astonished at His rebuke.

13 By His Spirit He adorned the heavens; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.

4 My lips will not speak wickedness, Nor my tongue utter deceit.
5 Far be it from me That I should say you are right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; My heart shall not reproach <font color="#999999"><em>me</em></font> as long as I live.
7 “May my enemy be like the wicked, And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.
8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, Though he may gain <font color="#999999"><em>much,</em></font> If God takes away his life?
9 Will God hear his cry When trouble comes upon him?
10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call on God?
11 “I will teach you about the hand of God; What <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> with the Almighty I will not conceal.
12 Surely all of you have seen <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> Why then do you behave with complete nonsense?

17 He may pile <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> up, but the just will wear <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> And the innocent will divide the silver.

<br><font color="#999999">Job’s Discourse on Wisdom</font><br><br>1 “Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place <font color="#999999"><em>where</em></font> gold is refined.
2 Iron is taken from the earth, And copper <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> smelted <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> ore.
3 <font color="#999999"><em>Man</em></font> puts an end to darkness, And searches every recess For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death.

5 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> the earth, from it comes bread, But underneath it is turned up as by fire;
6 Its stones <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the source of sapphires, And it contains gold dust.
7 <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> path no bird knows, Nor has the falcon’s eye seen it.
8 The proud lions have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it.
9 He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the roots.
10 He cuts out channels in the rocks, And his eye sees every precious thing.
11 He dams up the streams from trickling; <font color="#999999"><em>What is</em></font> hidden he brings forth to light.
12 “But where can wisdom be found? And where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the place of understanding?
13 Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living.
14 The deep says, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not in me’; And the sea says, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not with me.’
15 It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> its price.
16 It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx or sapphire.
17 Neither gold nor crystal can equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold.
18 No mention shall be made of coral or quartz, For the price of wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> above rubies.
19 The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold.
20 “From where then does wisdom come? And where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the place of understanding?
21 It is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the air.
22 Destruction and Death say, ‘We have heard a report about it with our ears.’
23 God understands its way, And He knows its place.
24 For He looks to the ends of the earth, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> sees under the whole heavens,
25 To establish a weight for the wind, And apportion the waters by measure.
26 When He made a law for the rain, And a path for the thunderbolt,
27 Then He saw <font color="#999999"><em>wisdom</em></font> and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.
28 And to man He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wisdom, And to depart from evil <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> understanding.’ ”

9 The princes refrained from talking, And put <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> hand on their mouth;
10 The voice of nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
11 When the ear heard, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw, then it approved me;
12 Because I delivered the poor who cried out, The fatherless and <font color="#999999"><em>the one who</em></font> had no helper.
13 The blessing of a perishing <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> came upon me, And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like a robe and a turban.
15 I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> eyes to the blind, And I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> feet to the lame.
16 I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a father to the poor, And I searched out the case <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> I did not know.
17 I broke the fangs of the wicked, And plucked the victim from his teeth.
18 “Then I said, ‘I shall die in my nest, And multiply <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> days as the sand.
19 My root <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> spread out to the waters, And the dew lies all night on my branch.
20 My glory <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> fresh within me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.’
21 “<font color="#999999"><em>Men</em></font> listened to me and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.
22 After my words they did not speak again, And my speech settled on them <font color="#999999"><em>as dew.</em></font>
23 They waited for me <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> for the rain, And they opened their mouth wide <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> for the spring rain.
24 <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> I mocked at them, they did not believe <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> And the light of my countenance they did not cast down.
25 I chose the way for them, and sat as chief; So I dwelt as a king in the army, As one <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> comforts mourners.

2 Indeed, what <font color="#999999"><em>profit</em></font> is the strength of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished.
3 <font color="#999999"><em>They are</em></font> gaunt from want and famine, Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste,
4 Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And broom tree roots <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> their food.
5 They were driven out from among <font color="#999999"><em>men,</em></font> They shouted at them as <font color="#999999"><em>at</em></font> a thief.
6 <font color="#999999"><em>They had</em></font> to live in the clefts of the valleys, <font color="#999999"><em>In</em></font> caves of the earth and the rocks.
7 Among the bushes they brayed, Under the nettles they nestled.
8 <font color="#999999"><em>They were</em></font> sons of fools, Yes, sons of vile men; They were scourged from the land.
9 “And now I am their taunting song; Yes, I am their byword.
10 They abhor me, they keep far from me; They do not hesitate to spit in my face.
11 Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off restraint before me.
12 At <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> right <font color="#999999"><em>hand</em></font> the rabble arises; They push away my feet, And they raise against me their ways of destruction.
13 They break up my path, They promote my calamity; They have no helper.
14 They come as broad breakers; Under the ruinous storm they roll along.
15 Terrors are turned upon me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed like a cloud.
16 “And now my soul is poured out because of my <font color="#999999"><em>plight;</em></font> The days of affliction take hold of me.
17 My bones are pierced in me at night, And my gnawing pains take no rest.
18 By great force my garment is disfigured; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
19 He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes.
20 “I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You regard me.
21 <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> You have become cruel to me; With the strength of Your hand You oppose me.
22 You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride <font color="#999999"><em>on it;</em></font> You spoil my success.

24 “Surely He would not stretch out <font color="#999999"><em>His</em></font> hand against a heap of ruins, If they cry out when He destroys <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
25 Have I not wept for him who was in trouble? Has <font color="#999999"><em>not</em></font> my soul grieved for the poor?
26 But when I looked for good, evil came <font color="#999999"><em>to me;</em></font> And when I waited for light, then came darkness.
27 My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest; Days of affliction confront me.
28 I go about mourning, but not in the sun; I stand up in the assembly <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> cry out for help.
29 I am a brother of jackals, And a companion of ostriches.
30 My skin grows black and falls from me; My bones burn with fever.

3 <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> it not destruction for the wicked, And disaster for the workers of iniquity?
4 Does He not see my ways, And count all my steps?
5 “If I have walked with falsehood, Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,

7 If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart walked after my eyes, Or if any spot adheres to my hands,
8 <font color="#999999"><em>Then</em></font> let me sow, and another eat; Yes, let my harvest be rooted out.

10 <font color="#999999"><em>Then</em></font> let my wife grind for another, And let others bow down over her.

12 For that <font color="#999999"><em>would be</em></font> a fire <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> consumes to destruction, And would root out all my increase.
13 “If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me,
14 What then shall I do when God rises up? When He punishes, how shall I answer Him?
15 Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?
16 “If I have kept the poor from <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> desire, Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
17 Or eaten my morsel by myself, So that the fatherless could not eat of it

21 If I have raised my hand against the fatherless, When I saw I had help in the gate;
22 <font color="#999999"><em>Then</em></font> let my arm fall from my shoulder, Let my arm be torn from the socket.
23 For destruction <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a terror to me, And because of His magnificence I cannot endure.
24 “If I have made gold my hope, Or said to fine gold, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>You are</em></font> my confidence’;
25 If I have rejoiced because my wealth <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> great, And because my hand had gained much;

28 This also <font color="#999999"><em>would be</em></font> an iniquity <font color="#999999"><em>deserving of</em></font> judgment, For I would have denied God <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> above.
29 “If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, Or lifted myself up when evil found him
30 (Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his soul);
31 If the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?’

===
<br><font color="#999999">Elihu Contradicts Job’s Friends</font><br><br>1 So these three men ceased answering Job, because he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> righteous in his own eyes.
2 Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God.
3 Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and <font color="#999999"><em>yet</em></font> had condemned Job.
4 Now because they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job.
5 When Elihu saw that <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused.
6 So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: “I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> young in years, and you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you.
7 I said, ‘Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’
8 But <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.
9 Great men are not <font color="#999999"><em>always</em></font> wise, Nor do the aged <font color="#999999"><em>always</em></font> understand justice.
10 “Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.’
11 Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.
12 I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> answered his words —
13 Lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom’; God will vanquish him, not man.
14 Now he has not directed <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> words against me; So I will not answer him with your words.
15 “They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them.
16 And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> answered no more.
17 I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion.
18 For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me.
19 Indeed my belly <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like wine <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> has no vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins.
20 I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
21 Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man.
22 For I do not know how to flatter, <font color="#999999"><em>Else</em></font> my Maker would soon take me away.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Elihu Contradicts Job</font><br><br>1 “But please, Job, hear my speech, And listen to all my words.
2 Now, I open my mouth; My tongue speaks in my mouth.
3 My words <font color="#999999"><em>come</em></font> from my upright heart; My lips utter pure knowledge.
4 The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
5 If you can answer me, Set <font color="#999999"><em>your words</em></font> in order before me; Take your stand.
6 Truly I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> as your spokesman before God; I also have been formed out of clay.
7 Surely no fear of me will terrify you, Nor will my hand be heavy on you.
8 “Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> words, <font color="#999999"><em>saying,</em></font>
9 ‘I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> pure, without transgression; I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> innocent, and <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no iniquity in me.
10 Yet He finds occasions against me, He counts me as His enemy;
11 He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.’
12 “Look, <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> this you are not righteous. I will answer you, For God is greater than man.
13 Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give an accounting of any of His words.
14 For God may speak in one way, or in another, <font color="#999999"><em>Yet man</em></font> does not perceive it.
15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men, While slumbering on their beds,
16 Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction.
17 In order to turn man <font color="#999999"><em>from his</em></font> deed, And conceal pride from man,
18 He keeps back his soul from the Pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.
19 “<font color="#999999"><em>Man</em></font> is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with strong <font color="#999999"><em>pain</em></font> in many of his bones,
20 So that his life abhors bread, And his soul succulent food.
21 His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones stick out <font color="#999999"><em>which once</em></font> were not seen.
22 Yes, his soul draws near the Pit, And his life to the executioners.
23 “If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness,
24 Then He is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom’;
25 His flesh shall be young like a child’s, He shall return to the days of his youth.
26 He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness.
27 Then he looks at men and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted <font color="#999999"><em>what was</em></font> right, And it did not profit me.’
28 He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, And his life shall see the light.
29 “Behold, God works all these <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> Twice, <font color="#999999"><em>in fact,</em></font> three <font color="#999999"><em>times</em></font> with a man,
30 To bring back his soul from the Pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
31 “Give ear, Job, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will speak.
32 If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you.
33 If not, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Elihu Proclaims God’s Justice</font><br><br>1 Elihu further answered and said:
2 “Hear my words, you wise <font color="#999999"><em>men;</em></font> Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
3 For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food.
4 Let us choose justice for ourselves; Let us know among ourselves what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good.
5 “For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, But God has taken away my justice;
6 Should I lie concerning my right? My wound <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> incurable, <font color="#999999"><em>though I am</em></font> without transgression.’
7 What man <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like Job, <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> drinks scorn like water,
8 Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?
9 For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God.’
10 “Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: Far be it from God <font color="#999999"><em>to do</em></font> wickedness, And <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> the Almighty to <font color="#999999"><em>commit</em></font> iniquity.
11 For He repays man <font color="#999999"><em>according to</em></font> his work, And makes man to find a reward according to <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> way.
12 Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
13 Who gave Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed <font color="#999999"><em>Him over</em></font> the whole world?
14 If He should set His heart on it, <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,
15 All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust.
16 “If <font color="#999999"><em>you have</em></font> understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words:
17 Should one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn <font color="#999999"><em>Him who is</em></font> most just?
18 <font color="#999999"><em>Is it fitting</em></font> to say to a king, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>You are</em></font> worthless,’ <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> to nobles, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>You are</em></font> wicked’?
19 Yet He is not partial to princes, Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; For they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all the work of His hands.
20 In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; The people are shaken and pass away; The mighty are taken away without a hand.
21 “For His eyes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> on the ways of man, And He sees all his steps.
22 There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
23 For He need not further consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.
24 He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place.
25 Therefore He knows their works; He overthrows <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> in the night, And they are crushed.
26 He strikes them as wicked <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> In the open sight of others,
27 Because they turned back from Him, And would not consider any of His ways,
28 So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him; For He hears the cry of the afflicted.
29 When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble? And when He hides <font color="#999999"><em>His</em></font> face, who then can see Him, Whether <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> against a nation or a man alone? —
30 That the hypocrite should not reign, Lest the people be ensnared.
31 “For has <font color="#999999"><em>anyone</em></font> said to God, ‘I have borne <font color="#999999"><em>chastening;</em></font> I will offend no more;
32 Teach me <font color="#999999"><em>what</em></font> I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more’?
33 Should He repay <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> according to your <font color="#999999"><em>terms,</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>Just</em></font> because you disavow it? You must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what you know.
34 “Men of understanding say to me, Wise men who listen to me:
35 ‘Job speaks without knowledge, His words <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> without wisdom.’
36 Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, Because <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> answers <font color="#999999"><em>are like</em></font> those of wicked men!
37 For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps <font color="#999999"><em>his hands</em></font> among us, And multiplies his words against God.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Elihu Condemns Self-Righteousness</font><br><br>1 Moreover Elihu answered and said:
2 “Do you think this is right? Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?
3 For you say, ‘What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> I had sinned?’
4 “I will answer you, And your companions with you.
5 Look to the heavens and see; And behold the clouds — They are higher than you.
6 If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? Or, <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
7 If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
8 Your wickedness affects a man such as you, And your righteousness a son of man.
9 “Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.
10 But no one says, ‘Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,
11 Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?’
12 There they cry out, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men.
13 Surely God will not listen to empty <font color="#999999"><em>talk,</em></font> Nor will the Almighty regard it.
14 Although you say you do not see Him, <font color="#999999"><em>Yet</em></font> justice <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> before Him, and you must wait for Him.
15 And now, because He has not punished in His anger, Nor taken much notice of folly,
16 Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Elihu Proclaims God’s Goodness</font><br><br>1 Elihu also proceeded and said:
2 “Bear with me a little, and I will show you That <font color="#999999"><em>there are</em></font> yet words to speak on God’s behalf.
3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
4 For truly my words <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not false; One who is perfect in knowledge <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> with you.
5 “Behold, God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> mighty, but despises <font color="#999999"><em>no one;</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> mighty in strength of understanding.
6 He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives justice to the oppressed.
7 He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But <font color="#999999"><em>they are</em></font> on the throne with kings, For He has seated them forever, And they are exalted.
8 And if <font color="#999999"><em>they are</em></font> bound in fetters, Held in the cords of affliction,
9 Then He tells them their work and their transgressions — That they have acted defiantly.
10 He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity.
11 If they obey and serve <font color="#999999"><em>Him,</em></font> They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.
12 But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.
13 “But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; They do not cry for help when He binds them.
14 They die in youth, And their life <font color="#999999"><em>ends</em></font> among the perverted persons.
15 He delivers the poor in their affliction, And opens their ears in oppression.
16 “Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, <font color="#999999"><em>Into</em></font> a broad place where <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no restraint; And what is set on your table <font color="#999999"><em>would be</em></font> full of richness.
17 But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold <font color="#999999"><em>of you.</em></font>
18 Because <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> wrath, <font color="#999999"><em>beware</em></font> lest He take you away with <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
19 Will your riches, Or all the mighty forces, Keep you from distress?
20 Do not desire the night, When people are cut off in their place.
21 Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, For you have chosen this rather than affliction.
22 “Behold, God is exalted by His power; Who teaches like Him?
23 Who has assigned Him His way, Or who has said, ‘You have done wrong’?
<br><font color="#999999">Elihu Proclaims God’s Majesty</font><br><br>24 “Remember to magnify His work, Of which men have sung.
25 Everyone has seen it; Man looks on <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> from afar.
26 “Behold, God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> great, and we do not know <font color="#999999"><em>Him;</em></font> Nor can the number of His years <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> discovered.
27 For He draws up drops of water, Which distill as rain from the mist,
28 Which the clouds drop down <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> pour abundantly on man.
29 Indeed, can <font color="#999999"><em>anyone</em></font> understand the spreading of clouds, The thunder from His canopy?
30 Look, He scatters His light upon it, And covers the depths of the sea.
31 For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance.
32 He covers <font color="#999999"><em>His</em></font> hands with lightning, And commands it to strike.
33 His thunder declares it, The cattle also, concerning the rising <font color="#999999"><em>storm.</em></font>

<br><font color="#999999">God’s Works and Wisdom</font><br><br>1 “At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place.
2 Hear attentively the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> comes from His mouth.
3 He sends it forth under the whole heaven, His lightning to the ends of the earth.
4 After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard.
5 God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend.
6 For He says to the snow, ‘Fall <font color="#999999"><em>on</em></font> the earth’; Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength.
7 He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work.
8 The beasts go into dens, And remain in their lairs.
9 From the chamber <font color="#999999"><em>of the south</em></font> comes the whirlwind, And cold from the scattering winds <font color="#999999"><em>of the north.</em></font>
10 By the breath of God ice is given, And the broad waters are frozen.
11 Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds; He scatters His bright clouds.
12 And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of the whole earth.
13 He causes it to come, Whether for correction, Or for His land, Or for mercy.
14 “Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.
15 Do you know when God dispatches them, And causes the light of His cloud to shine?
16 Do you know how the clouds are balanced, Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
17 Why <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> your garments hot, When He quiets the earth by the south <font color="#999999"><em>wind?</em></font>
18 With Him, have you spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror?
19 “Teach us what we should say to Him, <font color="#999999"><em>For</em></font> we can prepare nothing because of the darkness.
20 Should He be told that I <font color="#999999"><em>wish to</em></font> speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up.
21 Even now <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> cannot look at the light <font color="#999999"><em>when it is</em></font> bright in the skies, When the wind has passed and cleared them.
22 He comes from the north <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> golden <font color="#999999"><em>splendor;</em></font> With God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> awesome majesty.
23 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> the Almighty, we cannot find Him; <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> excellent in power, <font color="#999999"><em>In</em></font> judgment and abundant justice; He does not oppress.
24 Therefore men fear Him; He shows no partiality to any <font color="#999999"><em>who are</em></font> wise of heart.”

<br><font color="#999999">The Lord Reveals His Omnipotence to Job</font><br><br>1 Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
2 “Who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> this who darkens counsel By words without knowledge?
3 Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me.
4 “Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell <font color="#999999"><em>Me,</em></font> if you have understanding.
5 Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
6 To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,
7 When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
8 “Or <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> issued from the womb;
9 When I made the clouds its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band;
10 When I fixed My limit for it, And set bars and doors;
11 When I said, ‘This far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves must stop!’
12 “Have you commanded the morning since your days <font color="#999999"><em>began,</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> caused the dawn to know its place,
13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?
14 It takes on form like clay <font color="#999999"><em>under</em></font> a seal, And stands out like a garment.
15 From the wicked their light is withheld, And the upraised arm is broken.
16 “Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths?
17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?
18 Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell <font color="#999999"><em>Me,</em></font> if you know all this.
19 “Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the way <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> the dwelling of light? And darkness, where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> its place,
20 That you may take it to its territory, That you may know the paths <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> its home?
21 Do you know <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> because you were born then, Or <font color="#999999"><em>because</em></font> the number of your days <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> great?
22 “Have you entered the treasury of snow, Or have you seen the treasury of hail,
23 Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, For the day of battle and war?
24 By what way is light diffused, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> the east wind scattered over the earth?
25 “Who has divided a channel for the overflowing <font color="#999999"><em>water,</em></font> Or a path for the thunderbolt,
26 To cause it to rain on a land <font color="#999999"><em>where there is</em></font> no one, A wilderness in which <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no man;
27 To satisfy the desolate waste, And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass?
28 Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
29 From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth?
30 The waters harden like stone, And the surface of the deep is frozen.
31 “Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the belt of Orion?
32 Can you bring out Mazzaroth in its season? Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs?
33 Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?
34 “Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That an abundance of water may cover you?
35 Can you send out lightnings, that they may go, And say to you, ‘Here we <font color="#999999"><em>are!</em></font>’?
36 Who has put wisdom in the mind? Or who has given understanding to the heart?
37 Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
38 When the dust hardens in clumps, And the clods cling together?
39 “Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
40 When they crouch in <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> dens, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> lurk in their lairs to lie in wait?
41 Who provides food for the raven, When its young ones cry to God, And wander about for lack of food?

<br><font color="#999999">God Continues to Challenge Job</font><br><br>1 “Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> can you mark when the deer gives birth?
2 Can you number the months <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bear young?
3 They bow down, They bring forth their young, They deliver their offspring.
4 Their young ones are healthy, They grow strong with grain; They depart and do not return to them.
5 “Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bonds of the onager,
6 Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the barren land his dwelling?
7 He scorns the tumult of the city; He does not heed the shouts of the driver.
8 The range of the mountains <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his pasture, And he searches after every green thing.
9 “Will the wild ox be willing to serve you? Will he bed by your manger?
10 Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes? Or will he plow the valleys behind you?
11 Will you trust him because his strength <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> great? Or will you leave your labor to him?
12 Will you trust him to bring home your grain, And gather it to your threshing floor?
13 “The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, But are her wings and pinions <font color="#999999"><em>like the</em></font> kindly stork’s?
14 For she leaves her eggs on the ground, And warms them in the dust;
15 She forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may break them.
16 She treats her young harshly, as though <font color="#999999"><em>they were</em></font> not hers; Her labor is in vain, without concern,
17 Because God deprived her of wisdom, And did not endow her with understanding.
18 When she lifts herself on high, She scorns the horse and its rider.
19 “Have you given the horse strength? Have you clothed his neck with thunder?
20 Can you frighten him like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror.
21 He paws in the valley, and rejoices in <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> strength; He gallops into the clash of arms.
22 He mocks at fear, and is not frightened; Nor does he turn back from the sword.
23 The quiver rattles against him, The glittering spear and javelin.
24 He devours the distance with fierceness and rage; Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet <font color="#999999"><em>has</em></font> sounded.
25 At <font color="#999999"><em>the blast of</em></font> the trumpet he says, ‘Aha!’ He smells the battle from afar, The thunder of captains and shouting.
26 “Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> spread its wings toward the south?
27 Does the eagle mount up at your command, And make its nest on high?
28 On the rock it dwells and resides, On the crag of the rock and the stronghold.
29 From there it spies out the prey; Its eyes observe from afar.
30 Its young ones suck up blood; And where the slain <font color="#999999"><em>are,</em></font> there it <font color="#999999"><em>is.</em></font>”

10 Then adorn yourself <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> majesty and splendor, And array yourself with glory and beauty.
11 Disperse the rage of your wrath; Look on everyone <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> proud, and humble him.
12 Look on everyone <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> proud, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place.
13 Hide them in the dust together, Bind their faces in hidden <font color="#999999"><em>darkness.</em></font>
14 Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you.
15 “Look now at the behemoth, which I made <font color="#999999"><em>along</em></font> with you; He eats grass like an ox.
16 See now, his strength <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in his hips, And his power <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in his stomach muscles.
17 He moves his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
18 His bones <font color="#999999"><em>are like</em></font> beams of bronze, His ribs like bars of iron.
19 He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the first of the ways of God; Only He who made him can bring near His sword.
20 Surely the mountains yield food for him, And all the beasts of the field play there.
21 He lies under the lotus trees, In a covert of reeds and marsh.
22 The lotus trees cover him <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> their shade; The willows by the brook surround him.
23 Indeed the river may rage, <font color="#999999"><em>Yet</em></font> he is not disturbed; He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth,
24 <font color="#999999"><em>Though</em></font> he takes it in his eyes, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> one pierces <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> nose with a snare.

2 Can you put a reed through his nose, Or pierce his jaw with a hook?
3 Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak softly to you?
4 Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as a servant forever?
5 Will you play with him as <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> a bird, Or will you leash him for your maidens?
6 Will <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> companions make a banquet of him? Will they apportion him among the merchants?
7 Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears?
8 Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle — Never do it again!
9 Indeed, <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> hope of <font color="#999999"><em>overcoming</em></font> him is false; Shall <font color="#999999"><em>one not</em></font> be overwhelmed at the sight of him?
10 No one <font color="#999999"><em>is so</em></font> fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand against Me?
11 Who has preceded Me, that I should pay <font color="#999999"><em>him?</em></font> Everything under heaven is Mine.
12 “I will not conceal his limbs, His mighty power, or his graceful proportions.
13 Who can remove his outer coat? Who can approach <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> with a double bridle?
14 Who can open the doors of his face, <font color="#999999"><em>With</em></font> his terrible teeth all around?
15 <font color="#999999"><em>His</em></font> rows of scales are <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> pride, Shut up tightly <font color="#999999"><em>as with</em></font> a seal;

17 They are joined one to another, They stick together and cannot be parted.
18 His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like the eyelids of the morning.
19 Out of his mouth go burning lights; Sparks of fire shoot out.
20 Smoke goes out of his nostrils, As <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> a boiling pot and burning rushes.
21 His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes out of his mouth.
22 Strength dwells in his neck, And sorrow dances before him.
23 The folds of his flesh are joined together; They are firm on him and cannot be moved.
24 His heart is as hard as stone, Even as hard as the lower <font color="#999999"><em>millstone.</em></font>
25 When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of his crashings they are beside themselves.
26 <font color="#999999"><em>Though</em></font> the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; Nor does spear, dart, or javelin.
27 He regards iron as straw, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> bronze as rotten wood.
28 The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones become like stubble to him.
29 Darts are regarded as straw; He laughs at the threat of javelins.
30 His undersides <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like sharp potsherds; He spreads pointed <font color="#999999"><em>marks</em></font> in the mire.
31 He makes the deep boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
32 He leaves a shining wake behind him; <font color="#999999"><em>One</em></font> would think the deep had white hair.
33 On earth there is nothing like him, Which is made without fear.
34 He beholds every high <font color="#999999"><em>thing;</em></font> He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> king over all the children of pride.”

<br><font color="#999999">Job’s Repentance and Restoration</font><br><br>1 Then Job answered the Lord and said:
2 “I know that You can do everything, And that no purpose <font color="#999999"><em>of Yours</em></font> can be withheld from You.
3 <font color="#999999"><em>You asked,</em></font> ‘Who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
4 Listen, please, and let me speak; <font color="#999999"><em>You said,</em></font> ‘I will question you, and you shall answer Me.’
5 “I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You.
6 Therefore I abhor <font color="#999999"><em>myself,</em></font> And repent in dust and ashes.”
7 And so it was, after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right, as My servant Job <font color="#999999"><em>has.</em></font>
8 Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you <font color="#999999"><em>according to your</em></font> folly; because you have not spoken of Me <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right, as My servant Job <font color="#999999"><em>has.</em></font>”
9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them; for the Lord had accepted Job.
10 And the Lord restored Job’s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
11 Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the Lord had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold.
12 Now the Lord blessed the latter <font color="#999999"><em>days</em></font> of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.
13 He also had seven sons and three daughters.
14 And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[g]</i></span>Keren-Happuch.
15 In all the land were found no women <font color="#999999"><em>so</em></font> beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
16 After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> four generations.
17 So Job died, old and full of days.
