2 But his delight <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night.
3 He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.
4 The ungodly <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not so, But <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like the chaff which the wind drives away.
5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

<br><font color="#999999">The Messiah’s Triumph and Kingdom</font><br><br>1 Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[c]</i></span>vain thing?
2 The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord and against His Anointed, <font color="#999999"><em>saying,</em></font>
3 “Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us.”
4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision.
5 Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, And distress them in His deep displeasure:
6 “Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion.”
7 “I will declare the decree: The Lord has said to Me, ‘You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> My Son, Today I have begotten You.
8 Ask of Me, and I will give <font color="#999999"><em>You</em></font> The nations <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> Your possession.
9 You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ ”
10 Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
11 Serve the Lord with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all those who put their trust in Him.

2 Give heed to the voice of my cry, My King and my God, For to You I will pray.
3 My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord; In the morning I will direct <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> to You, And I will look up.
4 For You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil dwell with You.
5 The boastful shall not stand in Your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity.
6 You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
7 But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy; In fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple.
8 Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before my face.
9 For <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> destruction; Their throat <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue.
10 Pronounce them guilty, O God! Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against You.
11 But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; Let those also who love Your name Be joyful in You.

6 I am weary with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears.
7 My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies.
8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.

2 Lest they tear me like a lion, Rending <font color="#999999"><em>me</em></font> in pieces, while <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> none to deliver.

8 The Lord shall judge the peoples; Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, And according to my integrity within me.
9 Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, But establish the just; For the righteous God tests the hearts and minds.
10 My defense <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> of God, Who saves the upright in heart.
11 God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a just judge, And God is angry <font color="#999999"><em>with the wicked</em></font> every day.
12 If he does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He bends His bow and makes it ready.
13 He also prepares for Himself instruments of death; He makes His arrows into fiery shafts.
14 Behold, <font color="#999999"><em>the wicked</em></font> brings forth iniquity; Yes, he conceives trouble and brings forth falsehood.
15 He made a pit and dug it out, And has fallen into the ditch <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> he made.
16 His trouble shall return upon his own head, And his violent dealing shall come down on his own crown.
17 I will praise the Lord according to His righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.

2 The wicked in <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> pride persecutes the poor; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.
3 For the wicked boasts of his heart’s desire; He blesses the greedy <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> renounces the Lord.
4 The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek <font color="#999999"><em>God;</em></font> God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in none of his thoughts.
5 His ways are always prospering; Your judgments <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> far above, out of his sight; <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> all his enemies, he sneers at them.
6 He has said in his heart, “I shall not be moved; I shall never be in adversity.”
7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> trouble and iniquity.
8 He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the secret places he murders the innocent; His eyes are secretly fixed on the helpless.
9 He lies in wait secretly, as a lion in his den; He lies in wait to catch the poor; He catches the poor when he draws him into his net.
10 So he crouches, he lies low, That the helpless may fall by his strength.
11 He has said in his heart, “God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will never see.”
12 Arise, O Lord! O God, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the humble.
13 Why do the wicked renounce God? He has said in his heart, “You will not require <font color="#999999"><em>an account.</em></font>”
14 But You have seen, for You observe trouble and grief, To repay <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> by Your hand. The helpless commits himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.
15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil <font color="#999999"><em>man;</em></font> Seek out his wickedness <font color="#999999"><em>until</em></font> You find none.

<br><font color="#999999">God the Sovereign Savior <br>To the Chief Musician. <font color="#999999"><em>A Psalm</em></font> of David the servant of the Lord, who spoke to the Lord the words of this song on the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he said:</font><br><br>1 I will love You, O Lord, my strength.
2 The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
3 I will call upon the Lord, <font color="#999999"><em>who is worthy</em></font> to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies.
4 The pangs of death surrounded me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
5 The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
6 In my distress I called upon the Lord, And cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry came before Him, <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> to His ears.
7 Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations of the hills also quaked and were shaken, Because He was angry.
8 Smoke went up from His nostrils, And devouring fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it.
9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down With darkness under His feet.
10 And He rode upon a cherub, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind.
11 He made darkness His secret place; His canopy around Him <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> dark waters <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> thick clouds of the skies.
12 From the brightness before Him, His thick clouds passed with hailstones and coals of fire.
13 The Lord thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.
14 He sent out His arrows and scattered the foe, Lightnings in abundance, and He vanquished them.
15 Then the channels of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O Lord, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
16 He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.
17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, For they were too strong for me.
18 They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the Lord was my support.
19 He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.
20 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
22 For all His judgments <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> before me, And I did not put away His statutes from me.
23 I was also blameless before Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity.
24 Therefore the Lord has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
25 With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless;
26 With the pure You will show Yourself pure; And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd.
27 For You will save the humble people, But will bring down haughty looks.
28 For You will light my lamp; The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.
29 For by You I can run against a troop, By my God I can leap over a wall.
30 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> God, His way <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> perfect; The word of the Lord is proven; He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a shield to all who trust in Him.
31 For who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God, except the Lord? And who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a rock, except our God?
32 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect.
33 He makes my feet like the <font color="#999999"><em>feet of</em></font> deer, And sets me on my high places.
34 He teaches my hands to make war, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
35 You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your right hand has held me up, Your gentleness has made me great.
36 You enlarged my path under me, So my feet did not slip.
37 I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them; Neither did I turn back again till they were destroyed.
38 I have wounded them, So that they could not rise; They have fallen under my feet.
39 For You have armed me with strength for the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
40 You have also given me the necks of my enemies, So that I destroyed those who hated me.
41 They cried out, but <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> none to save; <font color="#999999"><em>Even</em></font> to the Lord, but He did not answer them.
42 Then I beat them as fine as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like dirt in the streets.
43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me the head of the nations; A people I have not known shall serve me.
44 As soon as they hear of me they obey me; The foreigners submit to me.
45 The foreigners fade away, And come frightened from their hideouts.
46 The Lord lives! Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> my Rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted.
47 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> God who avenges me, And subdues the peoples under me;
48 He delivers me from my enemies. You also lift me up above those who rise against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.
49 Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the Gentiles, And sing praises to Your name.
50 Great deliverance He gives to His king, And shows mercy to His anointed, To David and his descendants forevermore.

3 When I kept silent, my bones grew old Through my groaning all the day long.
4 For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was turned into the drought of summer. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
5 I acknowledged my sin to You, And my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,” And You forgave the iniquity of my sin. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
6 For this cause everyone who is godly shall pray to You In a time when You may be found; Surely in a flood of great waters They shall not come near him.
7 You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall surround me with songs of deliverance. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye.

3 The words of his mouth <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> to do good.
4 He devises wickedness on his bed; He sets himself in a way <font color="#999999"><em>that is</em></font> not good; He does not abhor evil.
5 Your mercy, O Lord, <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the heavens; Your faithfulness <font color="#999999"><em>reaches</em></font> to the clouds.
6 Your righteousness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like the great mountains; Your judgments <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a great deep; O Lord, You preserve man and beast.
7 How precious <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Your lovingkindness, O God! Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings.
8 They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.

4 Delight yourself also in the Lord, And He shall give you the desires of your heart.
5 Commit your way to the Lord, Trust also in Him, And He shall bring <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> to pass.
6 He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your justice as the noonday.
7 Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass.
8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret — <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> only <font color="#999999"><em>causes</em></font> harm.

14 The wicked have drawn the sword And have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay those who are of upright conduct.
15 Their sword shall enter their own heart, And their bows shall be broken.
16 A little that a righteous man has <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> better than the riches of many wicked.

19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
20 But the wicked shall perish; And the enemies of the Lord, Like the splendor of the meadows, shall vanish. Into smoke they shall vanish away.

30 The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, And his tongue talks of justice.
31 The law of his God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in his heart; None of his steps shall slide.

A Contemplation of the sons of Korah.</font><br><br>1 As the deer pants for the water brooks, So pants my soul for You, O God.
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
3 My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say to me, “Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your God?”
4 When I remember these <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, With a multitude that kept a pilgrim feast.
5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? And <font color="#999999"><em>why</em></font> are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him <font color="#999999"><em>For</em></font> the help of His countenance.
6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me; Therefore I will remember You from the land of the Jordan, And from the heights of Hermon, From the Hill Mizar.
7 Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; All Your waves and billows have gone over me.
8 The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, And in the night His song <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> with me — A prayer to the God of my life.
9 I will say to God my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
10 <font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> with a breaking of my bones, My enemies reproach me, While they say to me all day long, “Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your God?”
11 Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.

<br><font color="#999999">Prayer to God in Time of Trouble</font><br><br>1 Vindicate me, O God, And plead my cause against an ungodly nation; Oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
2 For You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the God of my strength; Why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
3 Oh, send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your tabernacle.
4 Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And on the harp I will praise You, O God, my God.
5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.

<br><font color="#999999">Redemption Remembered in Present Dishonor <br>To the Chief Musician. A Contemplation of the sons of Korah.</font><br><br>1 We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, The deeds You did in their days, In days of old:
2 You drove out the nations with Your hand, But them You planted; You afflicted the peoples, and cast them out.
3 For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword, Nor did their own arm save them; But it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your countenance, Because You favored them.
4 You are my King, O God; Command victories for Jacob.
5 Through You we will push down our enemies; Through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.
6 For I will not trust in my bow, Nor shall my sword save me.
7 But You have saved us from our enemies, And have put to shame those who hated us.
8 In God we boast all day long, And praise Your name forever. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
9 But You have cast <font color="#999999"><em>us</em></font> off and put us to shame, And You do not go out with our armies.
10 You make us turn back from the enemy, And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.
11 You have given us up like sheep <font color="#999999"><em>intended</em></font> for food, And have scattered us among the nations.
12 You sell Your people for <font color="#999999"><em>next to</em></font> nothing, And are not enriched by selling them.
13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scorn and a derision to those all around us.
14 You make us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.
15 My dishonor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> continually before me, And the shame of my face has covered me,
16 Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, Because of the enemy and the avenger.
17 All this has come upon us; But we have not forgotten You, Nor have we dealt falsely with Your covenant.
18 Our heart has not turned back, Nor have our steps departed from Your way;
19 But You have severely broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
20 If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or stretched out our hands to a foreign god,
21 Would not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.
22 Yet for Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
23 Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arise! Do not cast <font color="#999999"><em>us</em></font> off forever.
24 Why do You hide Your face, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> forget our affliction and our oppression?
25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust; Our body clings to the ground.
26 Arise for our help, And redeem us for Your mercies’ sake.

11 So the King will greatly desire your beauty; Because He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your Lord, worship Him.
12 And the daughter of Tyre <font color="#999999"><em>will come</em></font> with a gift; The rich among the people will seek your favor.

15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought; They shall enter the King’s palace.
16 Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons, Whom You shall make princes in all the earth.
17 I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.

<br><font color="#999999">The Confidence of the Foolish <br>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.</font><br><br>1 Hear this, all peoples; Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
2 Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
3 My mouth shall speak wisdom, And the meditation of my heart <font color="#999999"><em>shall give</em></font> understanding.
4 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will disclose my dark saying on the harp.
5 Why should I fear in the days of evil, <font color="#999999"><em>When</em></font> the iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
6 Those who trust in their wealth And boast in the multitude of their riches,
7 None <font color="#999999"><em>of them</em></font> can by any means redeem <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him —

9 That he should continue to live eternally, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> not see the Pit.

11 Their inner thought <font color="#999999"><em>is that</em></font> their houses <font color="#999999"><em>will last</em></font> forever, Their dwelling places to all generations; They call <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> lands after their own names.
12 Nevertheless man, <font color="#999999"><em>though</em></font> in honor, does not remain; He is like the beasts <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> perish.

18 Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.

16 As for me, I will call upon God, And the Lord shall save me.
17 Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry aloud, And He shall hear my voice.
18 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle <font color="#999999"><em>that was</em></font> against me, For there were many against me.
19 God will hear, and afflict them, Even He who abides from of old. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font> Because they do not change, Therefore they do not fear God.
20 He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; He has broken his covenant.
21 <font color="#999999"><em>The words</em></font> of his mouth were smoother than butter, But war <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in his heart; His words were softer than oil, Yet they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> drawn swords.
22 Cast your burden on the Lord, And He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.
23 But You, O God, shall bring them down to the pit of destruction; Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in You.

<br><font color="#999999">An Urgent Plea for Help in Trouble <br>To the Chief Musician. Set to “The Lilies.” <font color="#999999"><em>A Psalm</em></font> of David.</font><br><br>1 Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> neck.
2 I sink in deep mire, Where <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no standing; I have come into deep waters, Where the floods overflow me.
3 I am weary with my crying; My throat is dry; My eyes fail while I wait for my God.
4 Those who hate me without a cause Are more than the hairs of my head; They are mighty who would destroy me, <font color="#999999"><em>Being</em></font> my enemies wrongfully; Though I have stolen nothing, I <font color="#999999"><em>still</em></font> must restore <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
5 O God, You know my foolishness; And my sins are not hidden from You.
6 Let not those who wait for You, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed because of me; Let not those who seek You be confounded because of me, O God of Israel.
7 Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; Shame has covered my face.
8 I have become a stranger to my brothers, And an alien to my mother’s children;
9 Because zeal for Your house has eaten me up, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
10 When I wept <font color="#999999"><em>and chastened</em></font> my soul with fasting, That became my reproach.
11 I also made sackcloth my garment; I became a byword to them.
12 Those who sit in the gate speak against me, And I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the song of the drunkards.
13 But as for me, my prayer <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> to You, O Lord, <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> the acceptable time; O God, in the multitude of Your mercy, Hear me in the truth of Your salvation.
14 Deliver me out of the mire, And let me not sink; Let me be delivered from those who hate me, And out of the deep waters.
15 Let not the floodwater overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth on me.
16 Hear me, O Lord, for Your lovingkindness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good; Turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.
17 And do not hide Your face from Your servant, For I am in trouble; Hear me speedily.
18 Draw near to my soul, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> redeem it; Deliver me because of my enemies.
19 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; My adversaries <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all before You.
20 Reproach has broken my heart, And I am full of heaviness; I looked <font color="#999999"><em>for someone</em></font> to take pity, but <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> none; And for comforters, but I found none.
21 They also gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
22 Let their table become a snare before them, And their well-being a trap.
23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see; And make their loins shake continually.
24 Pour out Your indignation upon them, And let Your wrathful anger take hold of them.
25 Let their dwelling place be desolate; Let no one live in their tents.
26 For they persecute the <font color="#999999"><em>ones</em></font> You have struck, And talk of the grief of those You have wounded.
27 Add iniquity to their iniquity, And let them not come into Your righteousness.
28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, And not be written with the righteous.
29 But I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> poor and sorrowful; Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high.
30 I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify Him with thanksgiving.
31 <font color="#999999"><em>This</em></font> also shall please the Lord better than an ox <font color="#999999"><em>or</em></font> bull, Which has horns and hooves.
32 The humble shall see <font color="#999999"><em>this and</em></font> be glad; And you who seek God, your hearts shall live.
33 For the Lord hears the poor, And does not despise His prisoners.
34 Let heaven and earth praise Him, The seas and everything that moves in them.
35 For God will save Zion And build the cities of Judah, That they may dwell there and possess it.
36 Also, the descendants of His servants shall inherit it, And those who love His name shall dwell in it.

2 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; My steps had nearly slipped.
3 For I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> envious of the boastful, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
4 For <font color="#999999"><em>there are</em></font> no pangs in their death, But their strength <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> firm.
5 They <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not in trouble <font color="#999999"><em>as other</em></font> men, Nor are they plagued like <font color="#999999"><em>other</em></font> men.
6 Therefore pride serves as their necklace; Violence covers them <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> a garment.
7 Their eyes bulge with abundance; They have more than heart could wish.
8 They scoff and speak wickedly <font color="#999999"><em>concerning</em></font> oppression; They speak loftily.
9 They set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth.
10 Therefore his people return here, And waters of a full <font color="#999999"><em>cup</em></font> are drained by them.
11 And they say, “How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
12 Behold, these <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the ungodly, Who are always at ease; They increase <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> riches.
13 Surely I have cleansed my heart <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> vain, And washed my hands in innocence.
14 For all day long I have been plagued, And chastened every morning.
15 If I had said, “I will speak thus,” Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children.
16 When I thought <font color="#999999"><em>how</em></font> to understand this, It <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> too painful for me —
17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; <font color="#999999"><em>Then</em></font> I understood their end.
18 Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction.
19 Oh, how they are <font color="#999999"><em>brought</em></font> to desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.
20 As a dream when <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> awakes, <font color="#999999"><em>So,</em></font> Lord, when You awake, You shall despise their image.
21 Thus my heart was grieved, And I was vexed in my mind.
22 I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> so foolish and ignorant; I was <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> a beast before You.
23 Nevertheless I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> continually with You; You hold <font color="#999999"><em>me</em></font> by my right hand.
24 You will guide me with Your counsel, And afterward receive me <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> glory.
25 Whom have I in heaven <font color="#999999"><em>but You?</em></font> And <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> none upon earth <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> I desire besides You.
26 My flesh and my heart fail; <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
27 For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.
28 But <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God, That I may declare all Your works.

3 Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations. The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.
4 Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place; They set up their banners <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> signs.
5 They seem like men who lift up Axes among the thick trees.
6 And now they break down its carved work, all at once, With axes and hammers.
7 They have set fire to Your sanctuary; They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.
8 They said in their hearts, “Let us destroy them altogether.” They have burned up all the meeting places of God in the land.
9 We do not see our signs; <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> no longer any prophet; Nor <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> any among us who knows how long.

12 For God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> my King from of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
13 You divided the sea by Your strength; You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.
14 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> gave him <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
15 You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up mighty rivers.
16 The day <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Yours, the night also <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Yours; You have prepared the light and the sun.
17 You have set all the borders of the earth; You have made summer and winter.
18 Remember this, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> the enemy has reproached, O Lord, And <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> a foolish people has blasphemed Your name.
19 Oh, do not deliver the life of Your turtledove to the wild beast! Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.
20 Have respect to the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the haunts of <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[h]</i></span>cruelty.
21 Oh, do not let the oppressed return ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise Your name.
22 Arise, O God, plead Your own cause; Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.
23 Do not forget the voice of Your enemies; The tumult of those who rise up against You increases continually.

17 But they sinned even more against Him By rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.
18 And they tested God in their heart By asking for the food of their fancy.
19 Yes, they spoke against God: They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
20 Behold, He struck the rock, So that the waters gushed out, And the streams overflowed. Can He give bread also? Can He provide meat for His people?”
21 Therefore the Lord heard <font color="#999999"><em>this</em></font> and was furious; So a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also came up against Israel,
22 Because they did not believe in God, And did not trust in His salvation.
23 Yet He had commanded the clouds above, And opened the doors of heaven,
24 Had rained down manna on them to eat, And given them of the bread of heaven.
25 Men ate angels’ food; He sent them food to the full.
26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; And by His power He brought in the south wind.
27 He also rained meat on them like the dust, Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas;
28 And He let <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> fall in the midst of their camp, All around their dwellings.
29 So they ate and were well filled, For He gave them their own desire.
30 They were not deprived of their craving; But while their food <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> still in their mouths,
31 The wrath of God came against them, And slew the stoutest of them, And struck down the choice <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> of Israel.
32 In spite of this they still sinned, And did not believe in His wondrous works.
33 Therefore their days He consumed in futility, And their years in fear.
34 When He slew them, then they sought Him; And they returned and sought earnestly for God.
35 Then they remembered that God <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer.
36 Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouth, And they lied to Him with their tongue;
37 For their heart was not steadfast with Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant.
38 But He, <font color="#999999"><em>being</em></font> full of compassion, forgave <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> iniquity, And did not destroy <font color="#999999"><em>them.</em></font> Yes, many a time He turned His anger away, And did not stir up all His wrath;
39 For He remembered that they <font color="#999999"><em>were but</em></font> flesh, A breath that passes away and does not come again.
40 How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> grieved Him in the desert!
41 Yes, again and again they tempted God, And limited the Holy One of Israel.
42 They did not remember His power: The day when He redeemed them from the enemy,
43 When He worked His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan;
44 Turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, that they could not drink.
45 He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them, And frogs, which destroyed them.
46 He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust.
47 He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore trees with frost.
48 He also gave up their cattle to the hail, And their flocks to fiery lightning.
49 He cast on them the fierceness of His anger, Wrath, indignation, and trouble, By sending angels of destruction <font color="#999999"><em>among them.</em></font>
50 He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave their life over to the plague,
51 And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt, The first of <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> strength in the tents of Ham.
52 But He made His own people go forth like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
53 And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
54 And He brought them to His holy border, This mountain <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> His right hand had acquired.
55 He also drove out the nations before them, Allotted them an inheritance by survey, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
56 Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, And did not keep His testimonies,
57 But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
58 For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.
59 When God heard <font color="#999999"><em>this,</em></font> He was furious, And greatly abhorred Israel,
60 So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men,
61 And delivered His strength into captivity, And His glory into the enemy’s hand.
62 He also gave His people over to the sword, And was furious with His inheritance.
63 The fire consumed their young men, And their maidens were not given in marriage.
64 Their priests fell by the sword, And their widows made no lamentation.
65 Then the Lord awoke as <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> sleep, Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
66 And He beat back His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach.
67 Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
68 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.
69 And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has established forever.
70 He also chose David His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;
71 From following the ewes that had young He brought him, To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance.
72 So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

2 The dead bodies of Your servants They have given <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> food for the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
3 Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem, And <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no one to bury <font color="#999999"><em>them.</em></font>

5 How long, Lord? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
6 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You, And on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name.
7 For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his dwelling place.
8 Oh, do not remember former iniquities against us! Let Your tender mercies come speedily to meet us, For we have been brought very low.
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, For the glory of Your name; And deliver us, and provide atonement for our sins, For Your name’s sake!
10 Why should the nations say, “Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> their God?” Let there be known among the nations in our sight The avenging of the blood of Your servants <font color="#999999"><em>which has been</em></font> shed.
11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; According to the greatness of Your power Preserve those who are appointed to die;
12 And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
13 So we, Your people and sheep of Your pasture, Will give You thanks forever; We will show forth Your praise to all generations.

39 You have renounced the covenant of Your servant; You have profaned his crown <font color="#999999"><em>by casting it</em></font> to the ground.
40 You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
41 All who pass by the way plunder him; He is a reproach to his neighbors.
42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; You have made all his enemies rejoice.
43 You have also turned back the edge of his sword, And have not sustained him in the battle.
44 You have made his glory cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.
45 The days of his youth You have shortened; You have covered him with shame. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
46 How long, Lord? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath burn like fire?
47 Remember how short my time is; For what futility have You created all the children of men?
48 What man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his life from the power of the grave? <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
49 Lord, where <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> Your former lovingkindnesses, <font color="#999999"><em>Which</em></font> You swore to David in Your truth?
50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of Your servants — <font color="#999999"><em>How</em></font> I bear in my bosom <font color="#999999"><em>the reproach of</em></font> all the many peoples,
51 With which Your enemies have reproached, O Lord, With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.
52 Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> the Lord forevermore! Amen and Amen.

2 Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever You had formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> God.
3 You turn man to destruction, And say, “Return, O children of men.”
4 For a thousand years in Your sight <font color="#999999"><em>Are</em></font> like yesterday when it is past, And <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> a watch in the night.
5 You carry them away <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> a flood; <font color="#999999"><em>They are</em></font> like a sleep. In the morning they are like grass <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> grows up:
6 In the morning it flourishes and grows up; In the evening it is cut down and withers.
7 For we have been consumed by Your anger, And by Your wrath we are terrified.
8 You have set our iniquities before You, Our secret <font color="#999999"><em>sins</em></font> in the light of Your countenance.
9 For all our days have passed away in Your wrath; We finish our years like a sigh.
10 The days of our lives <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> seventy years; And if by reason of strength <font color="#999999"><em>they are</em></font> eighty years, Yet their boast <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> only labor and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
11 Who knows the power of Your anger? For as the fear of You, <font color="#999999"><em>so is</em></font> Your wrath.
12 So teach <font color="#999999"><em>us</em></font> to number our days, That we may gain a heart of wisdom.
13 Return, O Lord! How long? And have compassion on Your servants.
14 Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!
15 Make us glad according to the days <font color="#999999"><em>in which</em></font> You have afflicted us, The years <font color="#999999"><em>in which</em></font> we have seen evil.
16 Let Your work appear to Your servants, And Your glory to their children.
17 And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, And establish the work of our hands for us; Yes, establish the work of our hands.

<br><font color="#999999">Safety of Abiding in the Presence of God</font><br><br>1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say of the Lord, “<font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.”
3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> from the perilous pestilence.
4 He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth <font color="#999999"><em>shall be your</em></font> shield and buckler.
5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, <font color="#999999"><em>Nor</em></font> of the arrow <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> flies by day,
6 <font color="#999999"><em>Nor</em></font> of the pestilence <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> walks in darkness, <font color="#999999"><em>Nor</em></font> of the destruction <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> lays waste at noonday.
7 A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> it shall not come near you.
8 Only with your eyes shall you look, And see the reward of the wicked.
9 Because you have made the Lord, <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> my refuge, <font color="#999999"><em>Even</em></font> the Most High, your dwelling place,
10 No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;
11 For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways.
12 In <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.
14 “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name.
15 He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him.
16 With long life I will satisfy him, And show him My salvation.”

<br><font color="#999999">Praise to the Lord for His Love and Faithfulness <br>A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath day.</font><br><br>1 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> good to give thanks to the Lord, And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;
2 To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, And Your faithfulness every night,
3 On an instrument of ten strings, On the lute, And on the harp, With harmonious sound.
4 For You, Lord, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.
5 O Lord, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep.
6 A senseless man does not know, Nor does a fool understand this.
7 When the wicked spring up like grass, And when all the workers of iniquity flourish, <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> that they may be destroyed forever.
8 But You, Lord, <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> on high forevermore.
9 For behold, Your enemies, O Lord, For behold, Your enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
10 But my horn You have exalted like a wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
11 My eye also has seen <font color="#999999"><em>my desire</em></font> on my enemies; My ears hear <font color="#999999"><em>my desire</em></font> on the wicked Who rise up against me.
12 The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
13 Those who are planted in the house of the Lord Shall flourish in the courts of our God.
14 They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing,
15 To declare that the Lord is upright; <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> my rock, and <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no unrighteousness in Him.

<br><font color="#999999">The Eternal Reign of the Lord</font><br><br>1 The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved.
2 Your throne <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> established from of old; You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> from everlasting.
3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.
4 The Lord on high <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> mightier Than the noise of many waters, <font color="#999999"><em>Than</em></font> the mighty waves of the sea.
5 Your testimonies are very sure; Holiness adorns Your house, O Lord, forever.

<br><font color="#999999">God the Refuge of the Righteous</font><br><br>1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs — O God, to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth!
2 Rise up, O Judge of the earth; Render punishment to the proud.
3 Lord, how long will the wicked, How long will the wicked triumph?
4 They utter speech, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> speak insolent things; All the workers of iniquity boast in themselves.
5 They break in pieces Your people, O Lord, And afflict Your heritage.
6 They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the fatherless.
7 Yet they say, “The Lord does not see, Nor does the God of Jacob understand.”
8 Understand, you senseless among the people; And <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> fools, when will you be wise?
9 He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see?
10 He who instructs the nations, shall He not correct, He who teaches man knowledge?
11 The Lord knows the thoughts of man, That they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> futile.
12 Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the man whom You instruct, O Lord, And teach out of Your law,
13 That You may give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit is dug for the wicked.
14 For the Lord will not cast off His people, Nor will He forsake His inheritance.
15 But judgment will return to righteousness, And all the upright in heart will follow it.
16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
17 Unless the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>had been</em></font> my help, My soul would soon have settled in silence.
18 If I say, “My foot slips,” Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up.
19 In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.
20 Shall the throne of iniquity, which devises evil by law, Have fellowship with You?
21 They gather together against the life of the righteous, And condemn innocent blood.
22 But the Lord has been my defense, And my God the rock of my refuge.
23 He has brought on them their own iniquity, And shall cut them off in their own wickedness; The Lord our God shall cut them off.

6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.
7 For He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> our God, And we <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice:
8 “Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, As <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> the day of trial in the wilderness,
9 When your fathers tested Me; They tried Me, though they saw My work.
10 For forty years I was grieved with <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> generation, And said, ‘It <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.’

<br><font color="#999999">The Lord’s Eternal Love <br>A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the Lord.</font><br><br>1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, And let my cry come to You.
2 Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my trouble; Incline Your ear to me; In the day that I call, answer me speedily.
3 For my days are consumed like smoke, And my bones are burned like a hearth.
4 My heart is stricken and withered like grass, So that I forget to eat my bread.
5 Because of the sound of my groaning My bones cling to my skin.
6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.
7 I lie awake, And am like a sparrow alone on the housetop.
8 My enemies reproach me all day long; Those who deride me swear an oath against me.
9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,
10 Because of Your indignation and Your wrath; For You have lifted me up and cast me away.
11 My days <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like a shadow that lengthens, And I wither away like grass.
12 But You, O Lord, shall endure forever, And the remembrance of Your name to all generations.
13 You will arise <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> have mercy on Zion; For the time to favor her, Yes, the set time, has come.
14 For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, And show favor to her dust.
15 So the nations shall fear the name of the Lord, And all the kings of the earth Your glory.
16 For the Lord shall build up Zion; He shall appear in His glory.
17 He shall regard the prayer of the destitute, And shall not despise their prayer.
18 This will be written for the generation to come, That a people yet to be created may praise the Lord.
19 For He looked down from the height of His sanctuary; From heaven the Lord viewed the earth,
20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To release those appointed to death,
21 To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, And His praise in Jerusalem,
22 When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.
23 He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.
24 I said, “O my God, Do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> throughout all generations.
25 Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the work of Your hands.

7 At Your rebuke they fled; At the voice of Your thunder they hastened away.
8 They went up over the mountains; They went down into the valleys, To the place which You founded for them.
9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, That they may not return to cover the earth.
10 He sends the springs into the valleys; They flow among the hills.
11 They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
12 By them the birds of the heavens have their home; They sing among the branches.

24 O Lord, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all. The earth is full of Your possessions —
25 This great and wide sea, In which <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> innumerable teeming things, Living things both small and great.
26 There the ships sail about; <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> that Leviathan Which You have made to play there.

28 <font color="#999999"><em>What</em></font> You give them they gather in; You open Your hand, they are filled with good.
29 You hide Your face, they are troubled; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
30 You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the earth.
31 May the glory of the Lord endure forever; May the Lord rejoice in His works.
32 He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke.
33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
34 May my meditation be sweet to Him; I will be glad in the Lord.
35 May sinners be consumed from the earth, And the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!

4 Seek the Lord and His strength; Seek His face evermore!
5 Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
6 O seed of Abraham His servant, You children of Jacob, His chosen ones!
7 He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the Lord our God; His judgments <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in all the earth.
8 He remembers His covenant forever, The word <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> He commanded, for a thousand generations,
9 <font color="#999999"><em>The covenant</em></font> which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,
10 And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> an everlasting covenant,
11 Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan As the allotment of your inheritance,”
12 When they were few in number, Indeed very few, and strangers in it.
13 When they went from one nation to another, From <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> kingdom to another people,
14 He permitted no one to do them wrong; Yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes,
15 <font color="#999999"><em>Saying,</em></font> “Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm.”
16 Moreover He called for a famine in the land; He destroyed all the provision of bread.
17 He sent a man before them — Joseph — <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> was sold as a slave.
18 They hurt his feet with fetters, He was laid in irons.
19 Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the Lord tested him.
20 The king sent and released him, The ruler of the people let him go free.
21 He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his possessions,
22 To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.
23 Israel also came into Egypt, And Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.
24 He increased His people greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies.
25 He turned their heart to hate His people, To deal craftily with His servants.
26 He sent Moses His servant, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> Aaron whom He had chosen.
27 They performed His signs among them, And wonders in the land of Ham.
28 He sent darkness, and made <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> dark; And they did not rebel against His word.
29 He turned their waters into blood, And killed their fish.
30 Their land abounded with frogs, <font color="#999999"><em>Even</em></font> in the chambers of their kings.
31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> lice in all their territory.
32 He gave them hail for rain, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> flaming fire in their land.
33 He struck their vines also, and their fig trees, And splintered the trees of their territory.
34 He spoke, and locusts came, Young locusts without number,
35 And ate up all the vegetation in their land, And devoured the fruit of their ground.
36 He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land, The first of all their strength.
37 He also brought them out with silver and gold, And <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> none feeble among His tribes.
38 Egypt was glad when they departed, For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
39 He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.
40 <font color="#999999"><em>The people</em></font> asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
41 He opened the rock, and water gushed out; It ran in the dry places <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> a river.
42 For He remembered His holy promise, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> Abraham His servant.
43 He brought out His people with joy, His chosen ones with gladness.
44 He gave them the lands of the Gentiles, And they inherited the labor of the nations,
45 That they might observe His statutes And keep His laws. Praise the Lord!

5 That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, That I may glory with Your inheritance.
6 We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, We have done wickedly.
7 Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, But rebelled by the sea — the Red Sea.
8 Nevertheless He saved them for His name’s sake, That He might make His mighty power known.
9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up; So He led them through the depths, As through the wilderness.
10 He saved them from the hand of him who hated <font color="#999999"><em>them,</em></font> And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
11 The waters covered their enemies; There was not one of them left.
12 Then they believed His words; They sang His praise.
13 They soon forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel,
14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tested God in the desert.
15 And He gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.
16 When they envied Moses in the camp, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> Aaron the saint of the Lord,
17 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, And covered the faction of Abiram.
18 A fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.
19 They made a calf in Horeb, And worshiped the molded image.
20 Thus they changed their glory Into the image of an ox that eats grass.
21 They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,
22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, Awesome things by the Red Sea.
23 Therefore He said that He would destroy them, Had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach, To turn away His wrath, lest He destroy <font color="#999999"><em>them.</em></font>
24 Then they despised the pleasant land; They did not believe His word,
25 But complained in their tents, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> did not heed the voice of the Lord.
26 Therefore He raised His hand <font color="#999999"><em>in an oath</em></font> against them, To overthrow them in the wilderness,
27 To overthrow their descendants among the nations, And to scatter them in the lands.
28 They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor, And ate sacrifices made to the dead.
29 Thus they provoked <font color="#999999"><em>Him</em></font> to anger with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them.
30 Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, And the plague was stopped.
31 And that was accounted to him for righteousness To all generations forevermore.
32 They angered <font color="#999999"><em>Him</em></font> also at the waters of strife, So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;
33 Because they rebelled against His Spirit, So that he spoke rashly with his lips.
34 They did not destroy the peoples, Concerning whom the Lord had commanded them,
35 But they mingled with the Gentiles And learned their works;
36 They served their idols, Which became a snare to them.
37 They even sacrificed their sons And their daughters to demons,
38 And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.
39 Thus they were defiled by their own works, And played the harlot by their own deeds.
40 Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against His people, So that He abhorred His own inheritance.
41 And He gave them into the hand of the Gentiles, And those who hated them ruled over them.
42 Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
43 Many times He delivered them; But they rebelled in their counsel, And were brought low for their iniquity.
44 Nevertheless He regarded their affliction, When He heard their cry;
45 And for their sake He remembered His covenant, And relented according to the multitude of His mercies.
46 He also made them to be pitied By all those who carried them away captive.
47 Save us, O Lord our God, And gather us from among the Gentiles, To give thanks to Your holy name, To triumph in Your praise.
48 Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> the Lord God of Israel From everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise the Lord!

4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way; They found no city to dwell in.
5 Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.
6 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> He delivered them out of their distresses.
7 And He led them forth by the right way, That they might go to a city for a dwelling place.
8 Oh, that <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> would give thanks to the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> His goodness, And <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> His wonderful works to the children of men!
9 For He satisfies the longing soul, And fills the hungry soul with goodness.
10 Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Bound in affliction and irons —
11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, And despised the counsel of the Most High,
12 Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> none to help.
13 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> He saved them out of their distresses.
14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their chains in pieces.
15 Oh, that <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> would give thanks to the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> His goodness, And <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> His wonderful works to the children of men!
16 For He has broken the gates of bronze, And cut the bars of iron in two.
17 Fools, because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
18 Their soul abhorred all manner of food, And they drew near to the gates of death.
19 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> He saved them out of their distresses.
20 He sent His word and healed them, And delivered <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> from their destructions.

22 Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare His works with rejoicing.
23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, Who do business on great waters,
24 They see the works of the Lord, And His wonders in the deep.
25 For He commands and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up the waves of the sea.
26 They mount up to the heavens, They go down again to the depths; Their soul melts because of trouble.
27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits’ end.
28 Then they cry out to the Lord in their trouble, And He brings them out of their distresses.
29 He calms the storm, So that its waves are still.
30 Then they are glad because they are quiet; So He guides them to their desired haven.
31 Oh, that <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> would give thanks to the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> His goodness, And <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> His wonderful works to the children of men!
32 Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, And praise Him in the company of the elders.
33 He turns rivers into a wilderness, And the watersprings into dry ground;
34 A fruitful land into barrenness, For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
35 He turns a wilderness into pools of water, And dry land into watersprings.
36 There He makes the hungry dwell, That they may establish a city for a dwelling place,
37 And sow fields and plant vineyards, That they may yield a fruitful harvest.
38 He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly; And He does not let their cattle decrease.
39 When they are diminished and brought low Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow,
40 He pours contempt on princes, And causes them to wander in the wilderness <font color="#999999"><em>where there is</em></font> no way;
41 Yet He sets the poor on high, far from affliction, And makes <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> families like a flock.
42 The righteous see <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> and rejoice, And all iniquity stops its mouth.

13 He will bless those who fear the Lord, <font color="#999999"><em>Both</em></font> small and great.

15 <font color="#999999"><em>May</em></font> you <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> blessed by the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
16 The heaven, <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> the heavens, <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the Lord’s; But the earth He has given to the children of men.
17 The dead do not praise the Lord, Nor any who go down into silence.
18 But we will bless the Lord From this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord!

5 I cried out to You, O Lord: I said, “You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
6 Attend to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than I.
7 Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise Your name; The righteous shall surround me, For You shall deal bountifully with me.”

<br><font color="#999999">An Earnest Appeal for Guidance and Deliverance <br>A Psalm of David.</font><br><br>1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, Give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness answer me, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> in Your righteousness.
2 Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, For in Your sight no one living is righteous.
3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in darkness, Like those who have long been dead.
4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is distressed.
5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands.
6 I spread out my hands to You; My soul <font color="#999999"><em>longs</em></font> for You like a thirsty land. <em class="selah">Selah</em></font>
7 Answer me speedily, O Lord; My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those who go down into the pit.
8 Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, For in You do I trust; Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, For I lift up my soul to You.
9 Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies; In You I take shelter.
10 Teach me to do Your will, For You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> my God; Your Spirit <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.
11 Revive me, O Lord, for Your name’s sake! For Your righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.
12 In Your mercy cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> Your servant.

2 My lovingkindness and my fortress, My high tower and my deliverer, My shield and <font color="#999999"><em>the One</em></font> in whom I take refuge, Who subdues my people under me.
3 Lord, what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> man, that You take knowledge of him? <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> the son of man, that You are mindful of him?
4 Man is like a breath; His days <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like a passing shadow.
5 Bow down Your heavens, O Lord, and come down; Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
6 Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Shoot out Your arrows and destroy them.
7 Stretch out Your hand from above; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, From the hand of foreigners,
8 Whose mouth speaks lying words, And whose right hand <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a right hand of falsehood.
9 I will sing a new song to You, O God; On a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,

12 That our sons <font color="#999999"><em>may be</em></font> as plants grown up in their youth; <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> our daughters <font color="#999999"><em>may be</em></font> as pillars, Sculptured in palace style;
