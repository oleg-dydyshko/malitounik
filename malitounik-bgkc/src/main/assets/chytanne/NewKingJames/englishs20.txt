<br><font color="#999999">The Beginning of Knowledge</font><br><br>1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
2 To know wisdom and instruction, To perceive the words of understanding,
3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, Justice, judgment, and equity;
4 To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion —
5 A wise <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> will hear and increase learning, And a man of understanding will attain wise counsel,
6 To understand a proverb and an enigma, The words of the wise and their riddles.
7 The fear of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the beginning of knowledge, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> fools despise wisdom and instruction.
<br><font color="#999999">Shun Evil Counsel</font><br><br>8 My son, hear the instruction of your father, And do not forsake the law of your mother;
9 For they <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> a graceful ornament on your head, And chains about your neck.
10 My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.
11 If they say, “Come with us, Let us lie in wait to <font color="#999999"><em>shed</em></font> blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
12 Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, And whole, like those who go down to the Pit;
13 We shall find all <font color="#999999"><em>kinds</em></font> of precious possessions, We shall fill our houses with spoil;
14 Cast in your lot among us, Let us all have one purse” —
15 My son, do not walk in the way with them, Keep your foot from their path;
16 For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.
17 Surely, in vain the net is spread In the sight of any bird;
18 But they lie in wait for their <font color="#999999"><em>own</em></font> blood, They lurk secretly for their <font color="#999999"><em>own</em></font> lives.
19 So <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners.
<br><font color="#999999">The Call of Wisdom</font><br><br>20 Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares.
21 She cries out in the chief concourses, At the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words:
22 “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge.
23 Turn at my rebuke; Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.
24 Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded,
25 Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke,
26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your terror comes,
27 When your terror comes like a storm, And your destruction comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.
28 “Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.
29 Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the Lord,
30 They would have none of my counsel <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> despised my every rebuke.
31 Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own fancies.
32 For the turning away of the simple will slay them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them;
33 But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure, without fear of evil.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Value of Wisdom</font><br><br>1 My son, if you receive my words, And treasure my commands within you,
2 So that you incline your ear to wisdom, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> apply your heart to understanding;
3 Yes, if you cry out for discernment, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> lift up your voice for understanding,
4 If you seek her as silver, And search for her as <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> hidden treasures;
5 Then you will understand the fear of the Lord, And find the knowledge of God.
6 For the Lord gives wisdom; From His mouth <font color="#999999"><em>come</em></font> knowledge and understanding;
7 He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> a shield to those who walk uprightly;
8 He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints.
9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, Equity <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> every good path.
10 When wisdom enters your heart, And knowledge is pleasant to your soul,
11 Discretion will preserve you; Understanding will keep you,
12 To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse things,
13 From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness;
14 Who rejoice in doing evil, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> delight in the perversity of the wicked;
15 Whose ways <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> crooked, And <font color="#999999"><em>who are</em></font> devious in their paths;
16 To deliver you from the immoral woman, From the seductress <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> flatters with her words,
17 Who forsakes the companion of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God.
18 For her house leads down to death, And her paths to the dead;
19 None who go to her return, Nor do they regain the paths of life —
20 So you may walk in the way of goodness, And keep <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> the paths of righteousness.
21 For the upright will dwell in the land, And the blameless will remain in it;
22 But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, And the unfaithful will be uprooted from it.

<br><font color="#999999">Guidance for the Young</font><br><br>1 My son, do not forget my law, But let your heart keep my commands;
2 For length of days and long life And peace they will add to you.
3 Let not mercy and truth forsake you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart,
4 <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> so find favor and high esteem In the sight of God and man.
5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding;
6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.
7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from evil.
8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones.
9 Honor the Lord with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase;
10 So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine.
11 My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, Nor detest His correction;
12 For whom the Lord loves He corrects, Just as a father the son <font color="#999999"><em>in whom</em></font> he delights.
13 Happy <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the man <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> finds wisdom, And the man <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> gains understanding;
14 For her proceeds <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> better than the profits of silver, And her gain than fine gold.
15 She <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> more precious than rubies, And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her.
16 Length of days <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in her right hand, In her left hand riches and honor.
17 Her ways <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> ways of pleasantness, And all her paths <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> peace.
18 She <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy <font color="#999999"><em>are all</em></font> who retain her.
19 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding He established the heavens;
20 By His knowledge the depths were broken up, And clouds drop down the dew.
21 My son, let them not depart from your eyes — Keep sound wisdom and discretion;
22 So they will be life to your soul And grace to your neck.
23 Then you will walk safely in your way, And your foot will not stumble.
24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid; Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet.
25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes;
26 For the Lord will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being caught.
27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do <font color="#999999"><em>so.</em></font>
28 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font>” When you have it with you.
29 Do not devise evil against your neighbor, For he dwells by you for safety’s sake.
30 Do not strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm.
31 Do not envy the oppressor, And choose none of his ways;
32 For the perverse <font color="#999999"><em>person is</em></font> an abomination to the Lord, But His secret counsel <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> with the upright.
33 The curse of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the home of the just.
34 Surely He scorns the scornful, But gives grace to the humble.
35 The wise shall inherit glory, But shame shall be the legacy of fools.

<br><font color="#999999">Security in Wisdom</font><br><br>1 Hear, <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> children, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding;
2 For I give you good doctrine: Do not forsake my law.
3 When I was my father’s son, Tender and the only one in the sight of my mother,
4 He also taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commands, and live.
5 Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
6 Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you.
7 Wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the principal thing; <font color="#999999"><em>Therefore</em></font> get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding.
8 Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you honor, when you embrace her.
9 She will place on your head an ornament of grace; A crown of glory she will deliver to you.”
10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And the years of your life will be many.
11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths.
12 When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when you run, you will not stumble.
13 Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; Keep her, for she <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your life.
14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil.
15 Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on.
16 For they do not sleep unless they have done evil; And their sleep is taken away unless they make <font color="#999999"><em>someone</em></font> fall.
17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.
18 But the path of the just <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like the shining sun, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.
19 The way of the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like darkness; They do not know what makes them stumble.
20 My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.
21 Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart;
22 For they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.
23 Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it <font color="#999999"><em>spring</em></font> the issues of life.
24 Put away from you a deceitful mouth, And put perverse lips far from you.
25 Let your eyes look straight ahead, And your eyelids look right before you.
26 Ponder the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established.
27 Do not turn to the right or the left; Remove your foot from evil.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Peril of Adultery</font><br><br>1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom; Lend your ear to my understanding,
2 That you may preserve discretion, And your lips may keep knowledge.
3 For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, And her mouth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> smoother than oil;
4 But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
5 Her feet go down to death, Her steps lay hold of hell.
6 Lest you ponder <font color="#999999"><em>her</em></font> path of life — Her ways are unstable; You do not know <font color="#999999"><em>them.</em></font>
7 Therefore hear me now, <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> children, And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
8 Remove your way far from her, And do not go near the door of her house,
9 Lest you give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel <font color="#999999"><em>one;</em></font>
10 Lest aliens be filled with your wealth, And your labors <font color="#999999"><em>go</em></font> to the house of a foreigner;
11 And you mourn at last, When your flesh and your body are consumed,
12 And say: “How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised correction!
13 I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!
14 I was on the verge of total ruin, In the midst of the assembly and congregation.”
15 Drink water from your own cistern, And running water from your own well.
16 Should your fountains be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the streets?
17 Let them be only your own, And not for strangers with you.
18 Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice with the wife of your youth.
19 <font color="#999999"><em>As a</em></font> loving deer and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; And always be enraptured with her love.
20 For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman, And be embraced in the arms of a seductress?
21 For the ways of man <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> before the eyes of the Lord, And He ponders all his paths.
22 His own iniquities entrap the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man,</em></font> And he is caught in the cords of his sin.
23 He shall die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Dangerous Promises</font><br><br>1 My son, if you become surety for your friend, <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
2 You are snared by the words of your mouth; You are taken by the words of your mouth.
3 So do this, my son, and deliver yourself; For you have come into the hand of your friend: Go and humble yourself; Plead with your friend.
4 Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids.
5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand <font color="#999999"><em>of the hunter,</em></font> And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
<br><font color="#999999">The Folly of Indolence</font><br><br>6 Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise,
7 Which, having no captain, Overseer or ruler,
8 Provides her supplies in the summer, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> gathers her food in the harvest.
9 How long will you slumber, O sluggard? When will you rise from your sleep?
10 A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep —
11 So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler, And your need like an armed man.
<br><font color="#999999">The Wicked Man</font><br><br>12 A worthless person, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth;
13 He winks with his eyes, He shuffles his feet, He points with his fingers;
14 Perversity <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in his heart, He devises evil continually, He sows discord.
15 Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; Suddenly he shall be broken without remedy.
16 These six <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> the Lord hates, Yes, seven <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an abomination to Him:
17 A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood,
18 A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil,
19 A false witness <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren.
<br><font color="#999999">Beware of Adultery</font><br><br>20 My son, keep your father’s command, And do not forsake the law of your mother.
21 Bind them continually upon your heart; Tie them around your neck.
22 When you roam, they will lead you; When you sleep, they will keep you; And <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> you awake, they will speak with you.
23 For the commandment <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a lamp, And the law a light; Reproofs of instruction <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the way of life,
24 To keep you from the evil woman, From the flattering tongue of a seductress.
25 Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, Nor let her allure you with her eyelids.
26 For by means of a harlot <font color="#999999"><em>A man is reduced</em></font> to a crust of bread; And an adulteress will prey upon his precious life.
27 Can a man take fire to his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?
28 Can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be seared?
29 So <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.
30 <font color="#999999"><em>People</em></font> do not despise a thief If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving.
31 Yet <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> he is found, he must restore sevenfold; He may have to give up all the substance of his house.
32 Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; He <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> does so destroys his own soul.
33 Wounds and dishonor he will get, And his reproach will not be wiped away.
34 For jealousy <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a husband’s fury; Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
35 He will accept no recompense, Nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Wiles of a Harlot</font><br><br>1 My son, keep my words, And treasure my commands within you.
2 Keep my commands and live, And my law as the apple of your eye.
3 Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 Say to wisdom, “You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> my sister,” And call understanding <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> nearest kin,
5 That they may keep you from the immoral woman, From the seductress <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> flatters with her words.
<br><font color="#999999">The Crafty Harlot</font><br><br>6 For at the window of my house I looked through my lattice,
7 And saw among the simple, I perceived among the youths, A young man devoid of understanding,
8 Passing along the street near her corner; And he took the path to her house
9 In the twilight, in the evening, In the black and dark night.
10 And there a woman met him, <font color="#999999"><em>With</em></font> the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart.
11 She <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> loud and rebellious, Her feet would not stay at home.
12 At times <font color="#999999"><em>she was</em></font> outside, at times in the open square, Lurking at every corner.
13 So she caught him and kissed him; With an impudent face she said to him:
14 “<font color="#999999"><em>I have</em></font> peace offerings with me; Today I have paid my vows.
15 So I came out to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, And I have found you.
16 I have spread my bed with tapestry, Colored coverings of Egyptian linen.
17 I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
18 Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with love.
19 For my husband <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not at home; He has gone on a long journey;
20 He has taken a bag of money with him, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> will come home on the appointed day.”
21 With her enticing speech she caused him to yield, With her flattering lips she seduced him.
22 Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,
23 Till an arrow struck his liver. As a bird hastens to the snare, He did not know it <font color="#999999"><em>would cost</em></font> his life.
24 Now therefore, listen to me, <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth:
25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths;
26 For she has cast down many wounded, And all who were slain by her were strong <font color="#999999"><em>men.</em></font>
27 Her house <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the way to hell, Descending to the chambers of death.

<br><font color="#999999">The Excellence of Wisdom</font><br><br>1 Does not wisdom cry out, And understanding lift up her voice?
2 She takes her stand on the top of the high hill, Beside the way, where the paths meet.
3 She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city, At the entrance of the doors:
4 “To you, O men, I call, And my voice <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> to the sons of men.
5 O you simple ones, understand prudence, And you fools, be of an understanding heart.
6 Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, And from the opening of my lips <font color="#999999"><em>will come</em></font> right things;
7 For my mouth will speak truth; Wickedness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an abomination to my lips.
8 All the words of my mouth <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> with righteousness; Nothing crooked or perverse <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in them.
9 They <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.
10 Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold;
11 For wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than rubies, And all the things one may desire cannot be compared with her.
12 “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> discretion.
13 The fear of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverse mouth I hate.
14 Counsel <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> mine, and sound wisdom; I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> understanding, I have strength.
15 By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice.
16 By me princes rule, and nobles, All the judges of the earth.
17 I love those who love me, And those who seek me diligently will find me.
18 Riches and honor <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> with me, Enduring riches and righteousness.
19 My fruit <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than gold, yes, than fine gold, And my revenue than choice silver.
20 I traverse the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice,
21 That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, That I may fill their treasuries.
22 “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old.
23 I have been established from everlasting, From the beginning, before there was ever an earth.
24 When <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> no depths I was brought forth, When <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> no fountains abounding with water.
25 Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was brought forth;
26 While as yet He had not made the earth or the fields, Or the primal dust of the world.
27 When He prepared the heavens, I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> there, When He drew a circle on the face of the deep,
28 When He established the clouds above, When He strengthened the fountains of the deep,
29 When He assigned to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth,
30 Then I was beside Him <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a master craftsman; And I was daily <font color="#999999"><em>His</em></font> delight, Rejoicing always before Him,
31 Rejoicing in His inhabited world, And my delight <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> with the sons of men.
32 “Now therefore, listen to me, <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> children, For blessed <font color="#999999"><em>are those who</em></font> keep my ways.
33 Hear instruction and be wise, And do not disdain <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
34 Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.
35 For whoever finds me finds life, And obtains favor from the Lord;
36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; All those who hate me love death.”

<br><font color="#999999">The Way of Wisdom</font><br><br>1 Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out her seven pillars;

4 “Whoever <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> simple, let him turn in here!” <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> him who lacks understanding, she says to him,

7 “He who corrects a scoffer gets shame for himself, And he who rebukes a wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man only</em></font> harms himself.

9 Give <font color="#999999"><em>instruction</em></font> to a wise <font color="#999999"><em>man,</em></font> and he will be still wiser; Teach a just <font color="#999999"><em>man,</em></font> and he will increase in learning.
10 “The fear of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> understanding.

2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, But righteousness delivers from death.
3 The Lord will not allow the righteous soul to famish, But He casts away the desire of the wicked.
4 He who has a slack hand becomes poor, But the hand of the diligent makes rich.
5 He who gathers in summer <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a wise son; He who sleeps in harvest <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a son who causes shame.
6 Blessings <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> on the head of the righteous, But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
7 The memory of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> blessed, But the name of the wicked will rot.
8 The wise in heart will receive commands, But a prating fool will fall.
9 He who walks with integrity walks securely, But he who perverts his ways will become known.
10 He who winks with the eye causes trouble, But a prating fool will fall.
11 The mouth of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a well of life, But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
12 Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all sins.
13 Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has understanding, But a rod <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for the back of him who is devoid of understanding.
14 Wise <font color="#999999"><em>people</em></font> store up knowledge, But the mouth of the foolish <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> near destruction.
15 The rich man’s wealth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his strong city; The destruction of the poor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> their poverty.
16 The labor of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>leads</em></font> to life, The wages of the wicked to sin.
17 He who keeps instruction <font color="#999999"><em>is in</em></font> the way of life, But he who refuses correction goes astray.
18 Whoever hides hatred <font color="#999999"><em>has</em></font> lying lips, And whoever spreads slander <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a fool.
19 In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, But he who restrains his lips <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wise.
20 The tongue of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> choice silver; The heart of the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>is worth</em></font> little.
21 The lips of the righteous feed many, But fools die for lack of wisdom.
22 The blessing of the Lord makes <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> rich, And He adds no sorrow with it.
23 To do evil <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like sport to a fool, But a man of understanding has wisdom.
24 The fear of the wicked will come upon him, And the desire of the righteous will be granted.
25 When the whirlwind passes by, the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> no <font color="#999999"><em>more,</em></font> But the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>has</em></font> an everlasting foundation.
26 As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, So <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the lazy <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> to those who send him.
27 The fear of the Lord prolongs days, But the years of the wicked will be shortened.
28 The hope of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> gladness, But the expectation of the wicked will perish.
29 The way of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> strength for the upright, But destruction <font color="#999999"><em>will come</em></font> to the workers of iniquity.
30 The righteous will never be removed, But the wicked will not inhabit the earth.
31 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, But the perverse tongue will be cut out.

2 When pride comes, then comes shame; But with the humble <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wisdom.
3 The integrity of the upright will guide them, But the perversity of the unfaithful will destroy them.
4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death.
5 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way aright, But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.
6 The righteousness of the upright will deliver them, But the unfaithful will be caught by <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> lust.
7 When a wicked man dies, <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> expectation will perish, And the hope of the unjust perishes.
8 The righteous is delivered from trouble, And it comes to the wicked instead.
9 The hypocrite with <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> mouth destroys his neighbor, But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.
10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; And when the wicked perish, <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> jubilation.
11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
12 He who is devoid of wisdom despises his neighbor, But a man of understanding holds his peace.
13 A talebearer reveals secrets, But he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.
14 Where <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> safety.
15 He who is surety for a stranger will suffer, But one who hates being surety is secure.
16 A gracious woman retains honor, But ruthless <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> retain riches.
17 The merciful man does good for his own soul, But <font color="#999999"><em>he who is</em></font> cruel troubles his own flesh.
18 The wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> does deceptive work, But he who sows righteousness <font color="#999999"><em>will have</em></font> a sure reward.
19 As righteousness <font color="#999999"><em>leads</em></font> to life, So he who pursues evil <font color="#999999"><em>pursues it</em></font> to his own death.
20 Those who are of a perverse heart <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an abomination to the Lord, But <font color="#999999"><em>the</em></font> blameless in their ways <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> His delight.
21 <font color="#999999"><em>Though they join</em></font> forces, the wicked will not go unpunished; But the posterity of the righteous will be delivered.
22 <font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> a ring of gold in a swine’s snout, <font color="#999999"><em>So is</em></font> a lovely woman who lacks discretion.
23 The desire of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> only good, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> the expectation of the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wrath.
24 There is <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> who scatters, yet increases more; And there is <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> who withholds more than is right, But it <font color="#999999"><em>leads</em></font> to poverty.
25 The generous soul will be made rich, And he who waters will also be watered himself.
26 The people will curse him who withholds grain, But blessing <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> on the head of him who sells <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
27 He who earnestly seeks good finds favor, But trouble will come to him who seeks <font color="#999999"><em>evil.</em></font>
28 He who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will flourish like foliage.
29 He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind, And the fool <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> servant to the wise of heart.
30 The fruit of the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>is a</em></font> tree of life, And he who wins souls <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wise.

6 The words of the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>are,</em></font> “Lie in wait for blood,” But the mouth of the upright will deliver them.
7 The wicked are overthrown and <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> no more, But the house of the righteous will stand.
8 A man will be commended according to his wisdom, But he who is of a perverse heart will be despised.
9 Better <font color="#999999"><em>is the one</em></font> who is slighted but has a servant, Than he who honors himself but lacks bread.
10 A righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> regards the life of his animal, But the tender mercies of the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> cruel.
11 He who tills his land will be satisfied with bread, But he who follows frivolity <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> devoid of <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[e]</i></span>understanding.
12 The wicked covet the catch of evil <font color="#999999"><em>men,</em></font> But the root of the righteous yields <font color="#999999"><em>fruit.</em></font>
13 The wicked is ensnared by the transgression of <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> lips, But the righteous will come through trouble.
14 A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> mouth, And the recompense of a man’s hands will be rendered to him.
15 The way of a fool <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> right in his own eyes, But he who heeds counsel <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wise.
16 A fool’s wrath is known at once, But a prudent <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> covers shame.
17 He <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> speaks truth declares righteousness, But a false witness, deceit.
18 There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise <font color="#999999"><em>promotes</em></font> health.
19 The truthful lip shall be established forever, But a lying tongue <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> but for a moment.
20 Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, But counselors of peace have joy.
21 No grave trouble will overtake the righteous, But the wicked shall be filled with evil.
22 Lying lips <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an abomination to the Lord, But those who deal truthfully <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> His delight.
23 A prudent man conceals knowledge, But the heart of fools proclaims foolishness.
24 The hand of the diligent will rule, But the lazy <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> will be put to forced labor.
25 Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, But a good word makes it glad.
26 The righteous should choose his friends carefully, For the way of the wicked leads them astray.
27 The lazy <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> does not roast what he took in hunting, But diligence <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> man’s precious possession.

5 A righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> hates lying, But a wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> is loathsome and comes to shame.
6 Righteousness guards <font color="#999999"><em>him whose</em></font> way is blameless, But wickedness overthrows the sinner.

10 By pride comes nothing but strife, But with the well-advised <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> wisdom.
11 Wealth <font color="#999999"><em>gained by</em></font> dishonesty will be diminished, But he who gathers by labor will increase.

14 The law of the wise <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a fountain of life, To turn <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> away from the snares of death.
15 Good understanding gains favor, But the way of the unfaithful <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> hard.
16 Every prudent <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> acts with knowledge, But a fool lays open <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> folly.
17 A wicked messenger falls into trouble, But a faithful ambassador <font color="#999999"><em>brings</em></font> health.
18 Poverty and shame <font color="#999999"><em>will come</em></font> to him who disdains correction, But he who regards a rebuke will be honored.
19 A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, But <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> an abomination to fools to depart from evil.
20 He who walks with wise <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> will be wise, But the companion of fools will be destroyed.
21 Evil pursues sinners, But to the righteous, good shall be repaid.
22 A good <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.
23 Much food <font color="#999999"><em>is in</em></font> the fallow <font color="#999999"><em>ground</em></font> of the poor, And for lack of justice there is waste.

17 A quick-tempered <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> acts foolishly, And a man of wicked intentions is hated.

10 Divination <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the lips of the king; His mouth must not transgress in judgment.
11 Honest weights and scales <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the Lord’s; All the weights in the bag <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> His work.
12 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> an abomination for kings to commit wickedness, For a throne is established by righteousness.
13 Righteous lips <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the delight of kings, And they love him who speaks <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right.
14 As messengers of death <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the king’s wrath, But a wise man will appease it.
15 In the light of the king’s face <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> life, And his favor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like a cloud of the latter rain.
16 How much better to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
17 The highway of the upright <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> to depart from evil; He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
18 Pride <font color="#999999"><em>goes</em></font> before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.
19 Better <font color="#999999"><em>to be</em></font> of a humble spirit with the lowly, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
20 He who heeds the word wisely will find good, And whoever trusts in the Lord, happy <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> he.
21 The wise in heart will be called prudent, And sweetness of the lips increases learning.
22 Understanding <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a wellspring of life to him who has it. But the correction of fools <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> folly.
23 The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, And adds learning to his lips.
24 Pleasant words <font color="#999999"><em>are like</em></font> a honeycomb, Sweetness to the soul and health to the bones.
25 There is a way <font color="#999999"><em>that seems</em></font> right to a man, But its end <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the way of death.
26 The person who labors, labors for himself, For his <font color="#999999"><em>hungry</em></font> mouth drives him <font color="#999999"><em>on.</em></font>
27 An ungodly man digs up evil, And <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> on his lips like a burning fire.
28 A perverse man sows strife, And a whisperer separates the best of friends.
29 A violent man entices his neighbor, And leads him in a way <font color="#999999"><em>that is</em></font> not good.
30 He winks his eye to devise perverse things; He purses his lips <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> brings about evil.
31 The silver-haired head <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a crown of glory, <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> it is found in the way of righteousness.
32 <font color="#999999"><em>He who is</em></font> slow to anger <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.
33 The lot is cast into the lap, But its every decision <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> from the Lord.

2 A wise servant will rule over a son who causes shame, And will share an inheritance among the brothers.
3 The refining pot <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for silver and the furnace for gold, But the Lord tests the hearts.
4 An evildoer gives heed to false lips; A liar listens eagerly to a spiteful tongue.
5 He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; He who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.
6 Children’s children <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the crown of old men, And the glory of children <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> their father.
7 Excellent speech is not becoming to a fool, Much less lying lips to a prince.
8 A present <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor; Wherever he turns, he prospers.
9 He who covers a transgression seeks love, But he who repeats a matter separates friends.
10 Rebuke is more effective for a wise <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> Than a hundred blows on a fool.
11 An evil <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> seeks only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
12 Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs, Rather than a fool in his folly.
13 Whoever rewards evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house.
14 The beginning of strife <font color="#999999"><em>is like</em></font> releasing water; Therefore stop contention before a quarrel starts.
15 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just, Both of them alike <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an abomination to the Lord.
16 Why <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> in the hand of a fool the purchase price of wisdom, Since <font color="#999999"><em>he has</em></font> no heart <font color="#999999"><em>for it?</em></font>
17 A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.
18 A man devoid of understanding shakes hands in a pledge, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> becomes <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[e]</i></span>surety for his friend.
19 He who loves transgression loves strife, And he who exalts his gate seeks destruction.
20 He who has a deceitful heart finds no good, And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil.
21 He who begets a scoffer <font color="#999999"><em>does so</em></font> to his sorrow, And the father of a fool has no joy.
22 A merry heart does good, <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> medicine, But a broken spirit dries the bones.
23 A wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> accepts a bribe behind the back To pervert the ways of justice.
24 Wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the sight of him who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> on the ends of the earth.
25 A foolish son <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a grief to his father, And bitterness to her who bore him.
26 Also, to punish the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not good, <font color="#999999"><em>Nor</em></font> to strike princes for <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> uprightness.
27 He who has knowledge spares his words, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> a man of understanding is of a calm spirit.
28 Even a fool is counted wise when he holds his peace; <font color="#999999"><em>When</em></font> he shuts his lips, <font color="#999999"><em>he is considered</em></font> perceptive.

<br><font color="#999999">The Name of the Lord Is a Strong Tower</font><br><br>1 A man who isolates himself seeks his own desire; He rages against all wise judgment.

3 When the wicked comes, contempt comes also; And with dishonor <font color="#999999"><em>comes</em></font> reproach.
4 The words of a man’s mouth <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a flowing brook.
5 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not good to show partiality to the wicked, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
6 A fool’s lips enter into contention, And his mouth calls for blows.
7 A fool’s mouth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his destruction, And his lips <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the snare of his soul.
8 The words of a talebearer <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like tasty trifles, And they go down into the <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[d]</i></span>inmost body.
9 He who is slothful in his work Is a brother to him who is a great destroyer.
10 The name of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a strong tower; The righteous run to it and are safe.
11 The rich man’s wealth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his strong city, And like a high wall in his own esteem.
12 Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, And before honor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> humility.
13 He who answers a matter before he hears <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> It <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> folly and shame to him.
14 The spirit of a man will sustain him in sickness, But who can bear a broken spirit?
15 The heart of the prudent acquires knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
16 A man’s gift makes room for him, And brings him before great men.
17 The first <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> to plead his cause <font color="#999999"><em>seems</em></font> right, Until his neighbor comes and examines him.
18 Casting lots causes contentions to cease, And keeps the mighty apart.
19 A brother offended <font color="#999999"><em>is harder to win</em></font> than a strong city, And contentions <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like the bars of a castle.
20 A man’s stomach shall be satisfied from the fruit of his mouth; <font color="#999999"><em>From</em></font> the produce of his lips he shall be filled.
21 Death and life <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit.
22 <font color="#999999"><em>He who</em></font> finds a wife finds a good <font color="#999999"><em>thing,</em></font> And obtains favor from the Lord.
23 The poor <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> uses entreaties, But the rich answers roughly.
24 A man <font color="#999999"><em>who has</em></font> friends must himself be friendly, But there is a friend <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> sticks closer than a brother.

<br><font color="#999999">The Fear of the Lord Leads to Life</font><br><br>1 Better <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the poor who walks in his integrity Than <font color="#999999"><em>one who is</em></font> perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
2 Also it is not good <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> a soul <font color="#999999"><em>to be</em></font> without knowledge, And he sins who hastens with <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> feet.
3 The foolishness of a man twists his way, And his heart frets against the Lord.
4 Wealth makes many friends, But the poor is separated from his friend.
5 A false witness will not go unpunished, And <font color="#999999"><em>he who</em></font> speaks lies will not escape.
6 Many entreat the favor of the nobility, And every man <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a friend to one who gives gifts.
7 All the brothers of the poor hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He may pursue <font color="#999999"><em>them with</em></font> words, <font color="#999999"><em>yet</em></font> they abandon <font color="#999999"><em>him.</em></font>
8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good.
9 A false witness will not go unpunished, And <font color="#999999"><em>he who</em></font> speaks lies shall perish.
10 Luxury is not fitting for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule over princes.
11 The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, And his glory <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> to overlook a transgression.
12 The king’s wrath <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like the roaring of a lion, But his favor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like dew on the grass.
13 A foolish son <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the ruin of his father, And the contentions of a wife <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a continual dripping.
14 Houses and riches <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> from the Lord.
15 Laziness casts <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> into a deep sleep, And an idle person will suffer hunger.
16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> he who is careless of his ways will die.
17 He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, And He will pay back what he has given.
18 Chasten your son while there is hope, And do not set your heart on his destruction.
19 <font color="#999999"><em>A man of</em></font> great wrath will suffer punishment; For if you rescue <font color="#999999"><em>him,</em></font> you will have to do it again.
20 Listen to counsel and receive instruction, That you may be wise in your latter days.
21 There are many plans in a man’s heart, Nevertheless the Lord’s counsel — that will stand.
22 What is desired in a man is kindness, And a poor man is better than a liar.
23 The fear of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>leads</em></font> to life, And <font color="#999999"><em>he who has it</em></font> will abide in satisfaction; He will not be visited with evil.
24 A lazy <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> buries his hand in the bowl, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
25 Strike a scoffer, and the simple will become wary; Rebuke one who has understanding, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> he will discern knowledge.
26 He who mistreats <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> father <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> chases away <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> mother <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> a son who causes shame and brings reproach.
27 Cease listening to instruction, my son, And you will stray from the words of knowledge.
28 A disreputable witness scorns justice, And the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.
29 Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And beatings for the backs of fools.

5 Counsel in the heart of man <font color="#999999"><em>is like</em></font> deep water, But a man of understanding will draw it out.
6 Most men will proclaim each his own goodness, But who can find a faithful man?
7 The righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> walks in his integrity; His children <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> blessed after him.
8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment Scatters all evil with his eyes.

10 Diverse weights <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> diverse measures, They <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> both alike, an abomination to the Lord.
11 Even a child is known by his deeds, Whether what he does <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> pure and right.
12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye, The Lord has made them both.

16 Take the garment of one who is surety <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> a stranger, And hold it as a pledge <font color="#999999"><em>when it</em></font> is for a seductress.
17 Bread gained by deceit <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> sweet to a man, But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.
18 Plans are established by counsel; By wise counsel wage war.
19 He who goes about <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a talebearer reveals secrets; Therefore do not associate with one who flatters with his lips.
20 Whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp will be put out in deep darkness.
21 An inheritance gained hastily at the beginning Will not be blessed at the end.
22 Do not say, “I will recompense evil”; Wait for the Lord, and He will save you.
23 Diverse weights <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an abomination to the Lord, And dishonest scales <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not good.

27 The spirit of a man <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the lamp of the Lord, Searching all the inner depths of his heart.

9 Better to dwell in a corner of a housetop, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
10 The soul of the wicked desires evil; His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.
11 When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
12 The righteous <font color="#999999"><em>God</em></font> wisely considers the house of the wicked, Overthrowing the wicked for <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> wickedness.

25 The desire of the lazy <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> kills him, For his hands refuse to labor.
26 He covets greedily all day long, But the righteous gives and does not spare.
27 The sacrifice of the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an abomination; How much more <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> he brings it with wicked intent!
28 A false witness shall perish, But the man who hears <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> will speak endlessly.

3 Do not desire his delicacies, For they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> deceptive food.
4 Do not overwork to be rich; Because of your own understanding, cease!
5 Will you set your eyes on that which is not? For <font color="#999999"><em>riches</em></font> certainly make themselves wings; They fly away like an eagle <font color="#999999"><em>toward</em></font> heaven.
6 Do not eat the bread of a miser, Nor desire his delicacies;
7 For as he thinks in his heart, so <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> he. “Eat and drink!” he says to you, But his heart is not with you.
8 The morsel you have eaten, you will vomit up, And waste your pleasant words.
9 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
10 Do not remove the ancient landmark, Nor enter the fields of the fatherless;
11 For their Redeemer <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> mighty; He will plead their cause against you.
12 Apply your heart to instruction, And your ears to words of knowledge.
13 Do not withhold correction from a child, For <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> you beat him with a rod, he will not die.
14 You shall beat him with a rod, And deliver his soul from hell.
15 My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will rejoice — indeed, I myself;
16 Yes, my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak right things.
17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, But <font color="#999999"><em>be zealous</em></font> for the fear of the Lord all the day;
18 For surely there is a hereafter, And your hope will not be cut off.
19 Hear, my son, and be wise; And guide your heart in the way.
20 Do not mix with winebibbers, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> with gluttonous eaters of meat;
21 For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe <font color="#999999"><em>a man</em></font> with rags.
22 Listen to your father who begot you, And do not despise your mother when she is old.
23 Buy the truth, and do not sell <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>Also</em></font> wisdom and instruction and understanding.
24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who begets a wise <font color="#999999"><em>child</em></font> will delight in him.
25 Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her who bore you rejoice.
26 My son, give me your heart, And let your eyes observe my ways.
27 For a harlot <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a deep pit, And a seductress <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a narrow well.

31 Do not look on the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, <font color="#999999"><em>When</em></font> it swirls around smoothly;
32 At the last it bites like a serpent, And stings like a viper.
33 Your eyes will see strange things, And your heart will utter perverse things.
34 Yes, you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, Or like one who lies at the top of the mast, <font color="#999999"><em>saying:</em></font>

16 For a righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> may fall seven times And rise again, But the wicked shall fall by calamity.
17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;
18 Lest the Lord see <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> and it displease Him, And He turn away His wrath from him.
19 Do not fret because of evildoers, Nor be envious of the wicked;

26 He who gives a right answer kisses the lips.
27 Prepare your outside work, Make it fit for yourself in the field; And afterward build your house.
28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, For would you deceive with your lips?
29 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.”
30 I went by the field of the lazy <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font>, And by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding;

3 <font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> unsearchable.
4 Take away the dross from silver, And it will go to the silversmith <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> jewelry.
5 Take away the wicked from before the king, And his throne will be established in righteousness.
6 Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of the great;

8 One who increases his possessions by usury and extortion Gathers it for him who will pity the poor.
9 One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an abomination.
10 Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, He himself will fall into his own pit; But the blameless will inherit good.

24 Whoever is a partner with a thief hates his own life; He swears to tell the truth, but reveals nothing.
25 The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in the Lord shall be safe.
26 Many seek the ruler’s favor, But justice for man <font color="#999999"><em>comes</em></font> from the Lord.
27 An unjust man <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an abomination to the righteous, And <font color="#999999"><em>he who is</em></font> upright in the way <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an abomination to the wicked.

<br><font color="#999999">The Wisdom of Agur</font><br><br>1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> utterance. This man declared to Ithiel — to Ithiel and Ucal:
2 Surely I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> more stupid than <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> man, And do not have the understanding of a man.
3 I neither learned wisdom Nor have knowledge of the Holy One.
4 Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> His name, and what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> His Son’s name, If you know?
5 Every word of God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> pure; He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a shield to those who put their trust in Him.
6 Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar.
7 Two <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> I request of You (Deprive me not before I die):
8 Remove falsehood and lies far from me; Give me neither poverty nor riches — Feed me with the food allotted to me;
9 Lest I be full and deny <font color="#999999"><em>You,</em></font> And say, “Who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the Lord?” Or lest I be poor and steal, And profane the name of my God.
10 Do not malign a servant to his master, Lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.
11 <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> a generation <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> curses its father, And does not bless its mother.
12 <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> a generation <font color="#999999"><em>that is</em></font> pure in its own eyes, <font color="#999999"><em>Yet</em></font> is not washed from its filthiness.
13 <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> a generation — oh, how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.
14 <font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> a generation whose teeth <font color="#999999"><em>are like</em></font> swords, And whose fangs <font color="#999999"><em>are like</em></font> knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, And the needy from <font color="#999999"><em>among</em></font> men.
15 The leech has two daughters — Give <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Give! There are three <font color="#999999"><em>things that</em></font> are never satisfied, Four never say, “Enough!”:
16 The grave, The barren womb, The earth <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> is not satisfied with water — And the fire never says, “Enough!”
17 The eye <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> mocks <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> father, And scorns obedience to <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.
18 There are three <font color="#999999"><em>things which</em></font> are too wonderful for me, Yes, four <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> I do not understand:
19 The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin.
20 This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, “I have done no wickedness.”
21 For three <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> the earth is perturbed, Yes, for four it cannot bear up:
22 For a servant when he reigns, A fool when he is filled with food,
23 A hateful <font color="#999999"><em>woman</em></font> when she is married, And a maidservant who succeeds her mistress.
24 There are four <font color="#999999"><em>things which</em></font> are little on the earth, But they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> exceedingly wise:
25 The ants <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a people not strong, Yet they prepare their food in the summer;
26 The rock badgers are a feeble folk, Yet they make their homes in the crags;
27 The locusts have no king, Yet they all advance in ranks;
28 The spider skillfully grasps with its hands, And it is in kings’ palaces.
29 There are three <font color="#999999"><em>things which</em></font> are majestic in pace, Yes, four <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> are stately in walk:
30 A lion, <font color="#999999"><em>which is</em></font> mighty among beasts And does not turn away from any;
31 A greyhound, A male goat also, And a king <font color="#999999"><em>whose</em></font> troops <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> with him.
32 If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, Or if you have devised evil, <font color="#999999"><em>put your</em></font> hand on <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> mouth.
33 For <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> the churning of milk produces butter, And wringing the nose produces blood, So the forcing of wrath produces strife.

<br><font color="#999999">The Words of King Lemuel’s Mother</font><br><br>1 The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him:
2 What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?
3 Do not give your strength to women, Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
4 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not for kings, O Lemuel, <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not for kings to drink wine, Nor for princes intoxicating drink;
5 Lest they drink and forget the law, And pervert the justice of all the afflicted.
6 Give strong drink to him who is perishing, And wine to those who are bitter of heart.
7 Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more.
8 Open your mouth for the speechless, In the cause of all <font color="#999999"><em>who are</em></font> appointed to die.
9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, And plead the cause of the poor and needy.
<br><font color="#999999">The Virtuous Wife</font><br><br>10 Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> far above rubies.
11 The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain.
12 She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.
13 She seeks wool and flax, And willingly works with her hands.
14 She is like the merchant ships, She brings her food from afar.
15 She also rises while it is yet night, And provides food for her household, And a portion for her maidservants.
16 She considers a field and buys it; From her profits she plants a vineyard.
17 She girds herself with strength, And strengthens her arms.
18 She perceives that her merchandise <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good, And her lamp does not go out by night.
19 She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hand holds the spindle.
20 She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.
21 She is not afraid of snow for her household, For all her household <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> clothed with scarlet.
22 She makes tapestry for herself; Her clothing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> fine linen and purple.
23 Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.
24 She makes linen garments and sells <font color="#999999"><em>them,</em></font> And supplies sashes for the merchants.
25 Strength and honor <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> her clothing; She shall rejoice in time to come.
26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the law of kindness.
27 She watches over the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.
28 Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband <font color="#999999"><em>also,</em></font> and he praises her:
29 “Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all.”
30 Charm <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> deceitful and beauty <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> passing, But a woman <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
31 Give her of the fruit of her hands, And let her own works praise her in the gates.
