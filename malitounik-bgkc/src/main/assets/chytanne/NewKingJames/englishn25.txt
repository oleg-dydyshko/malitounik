<br><font color="#999999">Greeting</font><br><br>1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy <font color="#999999"><em>our</em></font> brother, To Philemon our beloved <font color="#999999"><em>friend</em></font> and fellow laborer,
2 to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><font color="#999999">Philemon’s Love and Faith</font><br><br>4 I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
5 hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
6 that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
7 For we have great joy and <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[e]</i></span>consolation in your love, because the <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[f]</i></span>hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
<br><font color="#999999">The Plea for Onesimus</font><br><br>8 Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting,
9 <font color="#999999"><em>yet</em></font> for love’s sake I rather appeal <font color="#999999"><em>to you</em></font> — being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ —
10 I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten <font color="#999999"><em>while</em></font> in my chains,
11 who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me.
12 I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
13 whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel.
14 But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary.
15 For perhaps he departed for a while for this <font color="#999999"><em>purpose,</em></font> that you might receive him forever,
16 no longer as a slave but more than a slave — a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
<br><font color="#999999">Philemon’s Obedience Encouraged</font><br><br>17 If then you count me as a partner, receive him as <font color="#999999"><em>you would</em></font> me.
18 But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account.
19 I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay — not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides.
20 Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.
21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
22 But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
<br><font color="#999999">Farewell</font><br><br>23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
24 <font color="#999999"><em>as do</em></font> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.
25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> with your spirit. Amen.
