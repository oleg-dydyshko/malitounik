<br><font color="#999999">Ezekiel’s Vision of God</font><br><br>1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the fifth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, as I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> among the captives by the River Chebar, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
2 On the fifth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, which <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity,
3 the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was upon him there.
4 Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
5 Also from within it <font color="#999999"><em>came</em></font> the likeness of four living creatures. And this <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
6 Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.
7 Their legs <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> straight, and the soles of their feet <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> like the soles of calves’ feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.
8 The hands of a man <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.
9 Their wings touched one another. <font color="#999999"><em>The creatures</em></font> did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.
10 As for the likeness of their faces, <font color="#999999"><em>each</em></font> had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.
11 Thus <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two <font color="#999999"><em>wings</em></font> of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies.
12 And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went.
13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning.
14 And the living creatures ran back and forth, in appearance like a flash of lightning.
15 Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces.
16 The appearance of the wheels and their workings <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings <font color="#999999"><em>was,</em></font> as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
17 When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went.
18 As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> full of eyes, all around the four of them.
19 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
20 Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, <font color="#999999"><em>because</em></font> there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in the wheels.
21 When those went, <font color="#999999"><em>these</em></font> went; when those stood, <font color="#999999"><em>these</em></font> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in the wheels.
22 The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads.
23 And under the firmament their wings <font color="#999999"><em>spread out</em></font> straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body.
24 When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.
25 A voice came from above the firmament that <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.
26 And above the firmament over their heads <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.
27 Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.
28 Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the appearance of the brightness all around it. This <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. <br><font color="#999999">Ezekiel Sent to Rebellious Israel</font><br><br>So when I saw <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Ezekiel Called to Be a Prophet</font><br><br>1 And He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.”
2 Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me.
3 And He said to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.
4 For <font color="#999999"><em>they are</em></font> impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’
5 As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse — for they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house — yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.
6 “And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house.
7 You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> rebellious.
8 But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”
9 Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in it.
10 Then He spread it before me; and <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> lamentations and mourning and woe.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Responsibility of the Prophet</font><br><br>1 Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
2 So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll.
3 And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you.” So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.
4 Then He said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.
5 For you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> to the house of Israel,
6 not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> impudent and hard-hearted.
8 Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.
9 Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house.”
10 Moreover He said to me: “Son of man, receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears.
11 And go, get to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ whether they hear, or whether they refuse.”
12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: “Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the glory of the Lord from His place!”
13 <font color="#999999"><em>I</em></font> also <font color="#999999"><em>heard</em></font> the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous noise.
14 So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.
15 Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
<br><font color="#999999">Ezekiel Is a Watchman</font><br><br>16 Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
17 “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:
18 When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.
19 Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
20 “Again, when a righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.
21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.”
22 Then the hand of the Lord was upon me there, and He said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and there I shall talk with you.”
23 So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.
24 Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: “Go, shut yourself inside your house.
25 And you, O son of man, surely they will put ropes on you and bind you with them, so that you cannot go out among them.
26 I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one to rebuke them, for they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house.
27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house.

<br><font color="#999999">The Siege of Jerusalem Portrayed</font><br><br>1 “You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, Jerusalem.
2 Lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around.
3 Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> a sign to the house of Israel.
4 “Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. <font color="#999999"><em>According</em></font> to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.
5 For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
6 And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.
7 “Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.
8 And surely I will restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.
9 “Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. <font color="#999999"><em>During</em></font> the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.
10 And your food which you eat <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.
11 You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink.
12 And you shall eat it <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> barley cakes; and bake it using fuel of human waste in their sight.”
13 Then the Lord said, “So shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.”
14 So I said, “Ah, Lord God! Indeed I have never defiled myself from my youth till now; I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.”
15 Then He said to me, “See, I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste, and you shall prepare your bread over it.”
16 Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, surely I will cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and with dread,
17 that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity.

===
<br><font color="#999999">A Sword Against Jerusalem</font><br><br>1 “And you, son of man, take a sharp sword, take it as a barber’s razor, and pass <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> over your head and your beard; then take scales to weigh and divide the <font color="#999999"><em>hair</em></font>.
2 You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter in the wind: I will draw out a sword after them.
3 You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your <font color="#999999"><em>garment.</em></font>
4 Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.
5 “Thus says the Lord God: ‘This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations and the countries all around her.
6 She has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around her; for they have refused My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.’
7 Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have multiplied <font color="#999999"><em>disobedience</em></font> more than the nations that <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you’ —
8 therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Indeed I, even I, <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations.
9 And I will do among you what I have never done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.
10 Therefore fathers shall eat <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments among you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds.
11 ‘Therefore, <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish <font color="#999999"><em>you;</em></font> My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity.
12 One-third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and one-third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter another third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
13 ‘Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be avenged; and they shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them.
14 Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
15 ‘So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a lesson, and an astonishment to the nations that <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you, when I execute judgments among you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken.
16 When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your supply of bread.
17 So I will send against you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, the Lord, have spoken.’ ”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Judgment on Idolatrous Israel</font><br><br>1 Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2 “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
3 and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: “Indeed I, <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.
4 Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> before your idols.
5 And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.
6 In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.
7 The slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
8 “Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries.
9 Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has departed from Me, and by their eyes which play the harlot after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they committed in all their abominations.
10 And they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord; I have not said in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.”
11 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Pound your fists and stamp your feet, and say, ‘Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
12 He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them.
13 Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered sweet incense to all their idols.
14 So I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.’ ” ’ ”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Judgment on Israel Is Near</font><br><br>1 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel: ‘An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
3 Now the end <font color="#999999"><em>has come</em></font> upon you, And I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, And I will repay you for all your abominations.
4 My eye will not spare you, Nor will I have pity; But I will repay your ways, And your abominations will be in your midst; Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord!’
5 “Thus says the Lord God: ‘A disaster, a singular disaster; Behold, it has come!
6 An end has come, The end has come; It has dawned for you; Behold, it has come!
7 Doom has come to you, you who dwell in the land; The time has come, A day of trouble <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> near, And not of rejoicing in the mountains.
8 Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, And spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, And I will repay you for all your abominations.
9 ‘My eye will not spare, Nor will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways, And your abominations will be in your midst. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord who strikes.
10 ‘Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Doom has gone out; The rod has blossomed, Pride has budded.
11 Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; None of them <font color="#999999"><em>shall remain,</em></font> None of their multitude, None of them; Nor <font color="#999999"><em>shall there be</em></font> wailing for them.
12 The time has come, The day draws near. ‘Let not the buyer rejoice, Nor the seller mourn, For wrath <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on their whole multitude.
13 For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, Though he may still be alive; For the vision concerns the whole multitude, And it shall not turn back; No one will strengthen himself Who lives in iniquity.
14 ‘They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, But no one goes to battle; For My wrath <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on all their multitude.
15 The sword <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> outside, And the pestilence and famine within. Whoever <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the field Will die by the sword; And whoever <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the city, Famine and pestilence will devour him.
16 ‘Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains Like doves of the valleys, All of them mourning, Each for his iniquity.
17 Every hand will be feeble, And every knee will be <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> weak <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> water.
18 They will also be girded with sackcloth; Horror will cover them; Shame <font color="#999999"><em>will be</em></font> on every face, Baldness on all their heads.
19 ‘They will throw their silver into the streets, And their gold will be like refuse; Their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them In the day of the wrath of the Lord; They will not satisfy their souls, Nor fill their stomachs, Because it became their stumbling block of iniquity.
20 ‘As for the beauty of his ornaments, He set it in majesty; But they made from it The images of their abominations — Their detestable things; Therefore I have made it Like refuse to them.
21 I will give it as plunder Into the hands of strangers, And to the wicked of the earth as spoil; And they shall defile it.
22 I will turn My face from them, And they will defile My secret place; For robbers shall enter it and defile it.
23 ‘Make a chain, For the land is filled with crimes of blood, And the city is full of violence.
24 Therefore I will bring the worst of the Gentiles, And they will possess their houses; I will cause the pomp of the strong to cease, And their holy places shall be defiled.
25 Destruction comes; They will seek peace, but <font color="#999999"><em>there shall be</em></font> none.
26 Disaster will come upon disaster, And rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; But the law will perish from the priest, And counsel from the elders.
27 ‘The king will mourn, The prince will be clothed with desolation, And the hands of the common people will tremble. I will do to them according to their way, And according to what they deserve I will judge them; Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord!’ ”

<br><font color="#999999">Abominations in the Temple</font><br><br>1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the fifth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, as I sat in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there.
2 Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire — from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber.
3 He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner <font color="#999999"><em>court,</em></font> where the seat of the image of jealousy <font color="#999999"><em>was,</em></font> which provokes to jealousy.
4 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.
5 Then He said to me, “Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was this image of jealousy in the entrance.
6 Furthermore He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.”
7 So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was a hole in the wall.
8 Then He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall”; and when I dug into the wall, there was a door.
9 And He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there.”
10 So I went in and saw, and there — every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed all around on the walls.
11 And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up.
12 Then He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, ‘The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land.’ ”
13 And He said to me, “Turn again, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> you will see greater abominations that they are doing.”
14 So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the Lord’s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
15 Then He said to me, “Have you seen <font color="#999999"><em>this,</em></font> O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.”
16 So He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.
17 And He said to me, “Have you seen <font color="#999999"><em>this,</em></font> O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose.
18 Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Wicked Are Slain</font><br><br>1 Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, “Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> a deadly weapon in his hand.”
2 And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his battle-ax in his hand. One man among them <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> clothed with linen and had a writer’s inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
3 Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who <font color="#999999"><em>had</em></font> the writer’s inkhorn at his side;
4 and the Lord said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”
5 To the others He said in my hearing, “Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity.
6 Utterly slay old <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> before the temple.
7 Then He said to them, “Defile the temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” And they went out and killed in the city.
8 So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left <font color="#999999"><em>alone;</em></font> and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, “Ah, Lord God! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?”
9 Then He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for they say, ‘The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see!’
10 And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> I will recompense their deeds on their own head.”
11 Just then, the man clothed with linen, who <font color="#999999"><em>had</em></font> the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, “I have done as You commanded me.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Glory Departs from the Temple</font><br><br>1 And I looked, and there in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
2 Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> over the city.” And he went in as I watched.
3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.
4 Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, <font color="#999999"><em>and paused</em></font> over the threshold of the temple; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory.
5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.
6 Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheels.
7 And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> among the cherubim, and took <font color="#999999"><em>some of it</em></font> and put <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> into the hands of the <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> clothed with linen, who took <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> and went out.
8 The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
9 And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared <font color="#999999"><em>to have</em></font> the color of a beryl stone.
10 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> their appearance, all four looked alike — as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
11 When they went, they went toward <font color="#999999"><em>any of</em></font> their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went.
12 And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> full of eyes all around.
13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “Wheel.”
14 Each one had four faces: the first face <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
15 And the cherubim were lifted up. This <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the living creature I saw by the River Chebar.
16 When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them.
17 When <font color="#999999"><em>the cherubim</em></font> stood still, <font color="#999999"><em>the wheels</em></font> stood still, and when <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> was lifted up, <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[h]</i></span><font color="#999999"><em>the other</em></font> lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in them.
18 Then the glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
19 And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> above them.
20 This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> cherubim.
21 Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> under their wings.
22 And the likeness of their faces <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the same <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance and their persons. They each went straight forward.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Judgment on Wicked Counselors</font><br><br>1 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the Lord’s house, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
2 And He said to me: “Son of man, these <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city,
3 who say, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>The time is</em></font> not near to build houses; this <font color="#999999"><em>city is</em></font> the caldron, and we <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the meat.’
4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!”
5 Then the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus says the Lord: “Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.
6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.”
7 Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the meat, and this <font color="#999999"><em>city is</em></font> the caldron; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it.
8 You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,” says the Lord God.
9 “And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments on you.
10 You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
11 This <font color="#999999"><em>city</em></font> shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the meat in its midst. I will judge you at the border of Israel.
12 And you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you.” ’ ”
13 Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah, Lord God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?”
<br><font color="#999999">God Will Restore Israel</font><br><br>14 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
15 “Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety, <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Get far away from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a possession.’
16 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.” ’
17 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.” ’
18 And they will go there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.
19 Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,
20 that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.
21 But <font color="#999999"><em>as for those</em></font> whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds on their own heads,” says the Lord God.
22 So the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> high above them.
23 And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the east side of the city.
24 Then the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.
25 So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the Lord had shown me.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Judah’s Captivity Portrayed</font><br><br>1 Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2 “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which has eyes to see but does not see, and ears to hear but does not hear; for they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house.
3 “Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for captivity, and go into captivity by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into captivity to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a rebellious house.
4 By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity.
5 Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry <font color="#999999"><em>your belongings</em></font> out through it.
6 In their sight you shall bear <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> on <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> shoulders <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> carry <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”
7 So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> out at twilight, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> I bore <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> on <font color="#999999"><em>my</em></font> shoulder in their sight.
8 And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
9 “Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’
10 Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “This burden <font color="#999999"><em>concerns</em></font> the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.” ’
11 Say, ‘I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall be carried away into captivity.’
12 And the prince who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> among them shall bear <font color="#999999"><em>his belongings</em></font> on <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> shoulder at twilight and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> eyes.
13 I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.
14 I will scatter to every wind all who <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them.
15 “Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.
16 But I will spare a few of their men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles wherever they go. Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.”
<br><font color="#999999">Judgment Not Postponed</font><br><br>17 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
18 “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.
19 And say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> to the land of Israel: “They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dread, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
20 Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.” ’ ”
21 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
22 “Son of man, what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> this proverb <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> you <font color="#999999"><em>people</em></font> have about the land of Israel, which says, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’?
23 Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will lay this proverb to rest, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.” ’ But say to them, ‘ “The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.
24 For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
25 For I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord. I speak, and the word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be postponed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and perform it,” says the Lord God.’ ”
26 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
27 “Son of man, look, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for many days <font color="#999999"><em>from now,</em></font> and he prophesies of times far off.’
28 Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “None of My words will be postponed any more, but the word which I speak will be done,” says the Lord God.’ ”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Woe to Foolish Prophets</font><br><br>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear the word of the Lord!’ ”
3 Thus says the Lord God: “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
4 O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts.
5 You have not gone up into the gaps to build a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle on the day of the Lord.
6 They have envisioned futility and false divination, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord!’ But the Lord has not sent them; yet they hope that the word may be confirmed.
7 Have you not seen a futile vision, and have you not spoken false divination? You say, ‘The Lord says,’ but I have not spoken.”
8 Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Because you have spoken nonsense and envisioned lies, therefore I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> indeed against you,” says the Lord God.
9 “My hand will be against the prophets who envision futility and who divine lies; they shall not be in the assembly of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord God.
10 “Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, ‘Peace!’ when <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no peace — and one builds a wall, and they plaster it with untempered <font color="#999999"><em>mortar</em></font> —
11 say to those who plaster <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with untempered <font color="#999999"><em>mortar,</em></font> that it will fall. There will be flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall tear <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> down.
12 Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, ‘Where <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the mortar with which you plastered <font color="#999999"><em>it?</em></font>’ ”
13 Therefore thus says the Lord God: “I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
14 So I will break down the wall you have plastered with untempered <font color="#999999"><em>mortar,</em></font> and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
15 “Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with untempered <font color="#999999"><em>mortar;</em></font> and I will say to you, ‘The wall <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> no <font color="#999999"><em>more,</em></font> nor those who plastered it,
16 <font color="#999999"><em>that is,</em></font> the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no peace,’ ” says the Lord God.
17 “Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,
18 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Woe to the <font color="#999999"><em>women</em></font> who sew <font color="#999999"><em>magic</em></font> charms on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive?
19 And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?”
20 ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> against your <font color="#999999"><em>magic</em></font> charms by which you hunt souls there like birds. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt like birds.
21 I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
22 “Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life.
23 Therefore you shall no longer envision futility nor practice divination; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.” ’ ”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Idolatry Will Be Punished</font><br><br>1 Now some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
2 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
3 “Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity. Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them?
4 “Therefore speak to them, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols,
5 that I may seize the house of Israel by their heart, because they are all estranged from Me by their idols.” ’
6 “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Repent, turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.
7 For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, then comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I the Lord will answer him by Myself.
8 I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
9 “And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I the Lord have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.
10 And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired,
11 that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God,” says the Lord God.’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">Judgment on Persistent Unfaithfulness</font><br><br>12 The word of the Lord came again to me, saying:
13 “Son of man, when a land sins against Me by persistent unfaithfulness, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of bread, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it.
14 Even <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver <font color="#999999"><em>only</em></font> themselves by their righteousness,” says the Lord God.
15 “If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they empty it, and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts,
16 <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>though</em></font> these three men <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in it, <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered, and the land would be desolate.
17 “Or <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land,’ and I cut off man and beast from it,
18 even <font color="#999999"><em>though</em></font> these three men <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in it, <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered.
19 “Or <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast,
20 even <font color="#999999"><em>though</em></font> Noah, Daniel, and Job <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in it, <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver <font color="#999999"><em>only</em></font> themselves by their righteousness.”
21 For thus says the Lord God: “How much more it shall be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem — the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence — to cut off man and beast from it?
22 Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, <font color="#999999"><em>both</em></font> sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it.
23 And they will comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause that I have done in it,” says the Lord God.

<br><font color="#999999">The Outcast Vine</font><br><br>1 Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2 “Son of man, how is the wood of the vine <font color="#999999"><em>better</em></font> than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?
3 Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> make a peg from it to hang any vessel on?
4 Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> work?
5 Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?
6 “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
7 and I will set My face against them. They will go out from <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> fire, but <font color="#999999"><em>another</em></font> fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I set My face against them.
8 Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,’ says the Lord God.”

<br><font color="#999999">God’s Love for Jerusalem</font><br><br>1 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
3 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem: “Your birth and your nativity <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> from the land of Canaan; your father <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
4 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse <font color="#999999"><em>you;</em></font> you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were loathed on the day you were born.
6 “And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’
7 I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. <font color="#999999"><em>Your</em></font> breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> naked and bare.
8 “When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the time of love; so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine,” says the Lord God.
9 “Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed off your blood, and I anointed you with oil.
10 I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
11 I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck.
12 And I put a jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
13 Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing <font color="#999999"><em>was of</em></font> fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate <font color="#999999"><em>pastry of</em></font> fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty.
14 Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you,” says the Lord God.
<br><font color="#999999">Jerusalem’s Harlotry</font><br><br>15 “But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who <font color="#999999"><em>would have</em></font> it.
16 You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and played the harlot on them. <font color="#999999"><em>Such</em></font> things should not happen, nor be.
17 You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them.
18 You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them.
19 Also My food which I gave you — the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> I fed you — you set it before them as sweet incense; and <font color="#999999"><em>so</em></font> it was,” says the Lord God.
20 “Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. <font color="#999999"><em>Were</em></font> your <font color="#999999"><em>acts</em></font> of harlotry a small matter,
21 that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through <font color="#999999"><em>the</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>fire?</em></font>
22 And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood.
23 “Then it was so, after all your wickedness — ‘Woe, woe to you!’ says the Lord God —
24 <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself in every street.
25 You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry.
26 You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.
27 “Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.
28 You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied.
29 Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.
30 “How degenerate is your heart!” says the Lord God, “seeing you do all these <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> the deeds of a brazen harlot.
<br><font color="#999999">Jerusalem’s Adultery</font><br><br>31 “You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment.
32 <font color="#999999"><em>You are</em></font> an adulterous wife, <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> takes strangers instead of her husband.
33 Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your lovers, and hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry.
34 You are the opposite of <font color="#999999"><em>other</em></font> women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.”
<br><font color="#999999">Jerusalem’s Lovers Will Abuse Her</font><br><br>35 ‘Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord!
36 Thus says the Lord God: “Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,
37 surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
38 And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.
39 I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.
40 “They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords.
41 They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you shall no longer hire lovers.
42 So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.
43 Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> surely I will also recompense your deeds on <font color="#999999"><em>your own</em></font> head,” says the Lord God. “And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your abominations.
<br><font color="#999999">More Wicked than Samaria and Sodom</font><br><br>44 “Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use <font color="#999999"><em>this</em></font> proverb against you: ‘Like mother, like daughter!’
45 You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> your mother’s daughter, loathing husband and children; and you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children; your mother <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
46 “Your elder sister <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Sodom and her daughters.
47 You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as <font color="#999999"><em>if that were</em></font> too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.
48 “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done.
49 Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
50 And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw <font color="#999999"><em>fit.</em></font>
51 “Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done.
52 You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because the sins which you committed were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.
53 “When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then <font color="#999999"><em>I will also bring back</em></font> the captives of your captivity among them,
54 that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did when you comforted them.
55 When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state.
56 For your sister Sodom was not a byword in your mouth in the days of your pride,
57 before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you everywhere.
58 You have paid for your lewdness and your abominations,” says the Lord.
59 For thus says the Lord God: “I will deal with you as you have done, who despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
<br><font color="#999999">An Everlasting Covenant</font><br><br>60 “Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; for I will give them to you for daughters, but not because of My covenant with you.
62 And I will establish My covenant with you. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord,
63 that you may remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide you an atonement for all you have done,” says the Lord God.’ ”

<br><font color="#999999">The Eagles and the Vine</font><br><br>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, pose a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
3 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “A great eagle with large wings and long pinions, Full of feathers of various colors, Came to Lebanon And took from the cedar the highest branch.
4 He cropped off its topmost young twig And carried it to a land of trade; He set it in a city of merchants.
5 Then he took some of the seed of the land And planted it in a fertile field; He placed <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> by abundant waters <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> set it like a willow tree.
6 And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; Its branches turned toward him, But its roots were under it. So it became a vine, Brought forth branches, And put forth shoots.
7 “But there was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, And stretched its branches toward him, From the garden terrace where it had been planted, That he might water it.
8 It was planted in good soil by many waters, To bring forth branches, bear fruit, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> become a majestic vine.” ’
9 “Say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, Cut off its fruit, And leave it to wither? All of its spring leaves will wither, And no great power or many people Will be needed to pluck it up by its roots.
10 Behold, <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> planted, Will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the garden terrace where it grew.” ’ ”
11 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
12 “Say now to the rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these <font color="#999999"><em>things mean?</em></font>’ Tell <font color="#999999"><em>them,</em></font> ‘Indeed the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and took its king and princes, and led them with him to Babylon.
13 And he took the king’s offspring, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,
14 that the kingdom might be brought low and not lift itself up, <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
15 But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?
16 ‘<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely in the place <font color="#999999"><em>where</em></font> the king <font color="#999999"><em>dwells</em></font> who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke — with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
17 Nor will Pharaoh with <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons.
18 Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave his hand and still did all these <font color="#999999"><em>things,</em></font> he shall not escape.’ ”
19 Therefore thus says the Lord God: “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense on his own head.
20 I will spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and try him there for the treason which he committed against Me.
21 All his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken.”
<br><font color="#999999">Israel Exalted at Last</font><br><br>22 Thus says the Lord God: “I will take also <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> of the highest branches of the high cedar and set <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> on a high and prominent mountain.
23 On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. Under it will dwell birds of every sort; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell.
24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree flourish; I, the Lord, have spoken and have done <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>”

<br><font color="#999999">A False Proverb Refuted</font><br><br>1 The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,
2 “What do you mean when you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge’?
3 “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel.
4 “Behold, all souls are Mine; The soul of the father As well as the soul of the son is Mine; The soul who sins shall die.
5 But if a man is just And does what is lawful and right;
6 If he has not eaten on the mountains, Nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, Nor defiled his neighbor’s wife, Nor approached a woman during her impurity;
7 If he has not oppressed anyone, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> has restored to the debtor his pledge; Has robbed no one by violence, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> has given his bread to the hungry And covered the naked with clothing;
8 If he has not exacted usury Nor taken any increase, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> has withdrawn his hand from iniquity <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> executed true judgment between man and man;
9 <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> he has walked in My statutes And kept My judgments faithfully — He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> just; He shall surely live!” Says the Lord God.
10 “If he begets a son <font color="#999999"><em>who is</em></font> a robber Or a shedder of blood, <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> does any of these <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font>
11 And does none of those <font color="#999999"><em>duties,</em></font> But has eaten on the mountains Or defiled his neighbor’s wife;
12 If he has oppressed the poor and needy, Robbed by violence, Not restored the pledge, Lifted his eyes to the idols, <font color="#999999"><em>Or</em></font> committed abomination;
13 If he has exacted usury Or taken increase — Shall he then live? He shall not live! If he has done any of these abominations, He shall surely die; His blood shall be upon him.
14 “<font color="#999999"><em>If,</em></font> however, he begets a son Who sees all the sins which his father has done, And considers but does not do likewise;
15 <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> has not eaten on the mountains, Nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, Nor defiled his neighbor’s wife;
16 Has not oppressed anyone, Nor withheld a pledge, Nor robbed by violence, <font color="#999999"><em>But</em></font> has given his bread to the hungry And covered the naked with clothing;
17 <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> has withdrawn his hand from the poor <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> not received usury or increase, But has executed My judgments And walked in My statutes — He shall not die for the iniquity of his father; He shall surely live!
18 “<font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> his father, Because he cruelly oppressed, Robbed his brother by violence, And did what <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not good among his people, Behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
<br><font color="#999999">Turn and Live</font><br><br>19 “Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not bear the guilt of the father?’ Because the son has done what is lawful and right, and has kept all My statutes and observed them, he shall surely live.
20 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
21 “But if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
22 None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; because of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live.
23 Do I have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?” says the Lord God, “<font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> not that he should turn from his ways and live?
24 “But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> does, shall he live? All the righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; because of the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty and the sin which he has committed, because of them he shall die.
25 “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ Hear now, O house of Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and your ways which are not fair?
26 When a righteous <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and dies in it, it is because of the iniquity which he has done that he dies.
27 Again, when a wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> turns away from the wickedness which he committed, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive.
28 Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair?
30 “Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways,” says the Lord God. “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your ruin.
31 Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house of Israel?
32 For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies,” says the Lord God. “Therefore turn and live!”

8 Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side, And spread their net over him; He was trapped in their pit.

<br><font color="#999999">The Rebellions of Israel</font><br><br>1 It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the tenth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and sat before me.
2 Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
3 “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Have you come to inquire of Me? <font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “I will not be inquired of by you.” ’
4 Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge <font color="#999999"><em>them?</em></font> Then make known to them the abominations of their fathers.
5 “Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand in an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand in an oath to them, saying, ‘I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord your God.’
6 On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, ‘flowing with milk and honey,’ the glory of all lands.
7 Then I said to them, ‘Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord your God.’
8 But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not all cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, ‘I will pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.’
9 But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles among whom they <font color="#999999"><em>were,</em></font> in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
10 “Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
11 And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, ‘which, <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> a man does, he shall live by them.’
12 Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord who sanctifies them.
13 Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, ‘which, <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> a man does, he shall live by them’; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.
14 But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out.
15 So I also raised My hand in an oath to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given <font color="#999999"><em>them,</em></font> ‘flowing with milk and honey,’ the glory of all lands,
16 because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
17 Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
18 “But I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
19 I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord your God: Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do them;
20 hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord your God.’
21 “Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and were not careful to observe My judgments, ‘which, <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> a man does, he shall live by them’; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.
22 Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out.
23 Also I raised My hand in an oath to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles and disperse them throughout the countries,
24 because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers’ idols.
25 “Therefore I also gave them up to statutes <font color="#999999"><em>that were</em></font> not good, and judgments by which they could not live;
26 and I pronounced them unclean because of their ritual gifts, in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through <font color="#999999"><em>the fire,</em></font> that I might make them desolate and that they might know that I am the Lord.” ’
27 “Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “In this too your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being unfaithful to Me.
28 When I brought them into the land <font color="#999999"><em>concerning</em></font> which I had raised My hand in an oath to give them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their sweet aroma and poured out their drink offerings.
29 Then I said to them, ‘What <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> this high place to which you go?’ So its name is called Bamah to this day.” ’
30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing harlotry according to their abominations?
31 For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? <font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “I will not be inquired of by you.
32 What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, ‘We will be like the Gentiles, like the families in other countries, serving wood and stone.’
<br><font color="#999999">God Will Restore Israel</font><br><br>33 “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.
34 I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.
35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead My case with you face to face.
36 Just as I pleaded My case with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will plead My case with you,” says the Lord God.
37 “I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
38 I will purge the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the country where they dwell, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
39 “As for you, O house of Israel,” thus says the Lord God: “Go, serve every one of you his idols — and hereafter — if you will not obey Me; but profane My holy name no more with your gifts and your idols.
40 For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel,” says the Lord God, “there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things.
41 I will accept you as a sweet aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will be hallowed in you before the Gentiles.
42 Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> which I raised My hand in an oath to give to your fathers.
43 And there you shall remember your ways and all your doings with which you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evils that you have committed.
44 Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I have dealt with you for My name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel,” says the Lord God.’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">Fire in the Forest</font><br><br>45 Furthermore the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
46 “Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest land, the South,
47 and say to the forest of the South, ‘Hear the word of the Lord! Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree and every dry tree in you; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it.
48 All flesh shall see that I, the Lord, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.” ’ ”
49 Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! They say of me, ‘Does he not speak parables?’ ”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Babylon, the Sword of God</font><br><br>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, preach against the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
3 and say to the land of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Behold, I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off both righteous and wicked from you.
4 Because I will cut off both righteous and wicked from you, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> north,
5 that all flesh may know that I, the Lord, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore.” ’
6 Sigh therefore, son of man, with a breaking heart, and sigh with bitterness before their eyes.
7 And it shall be when they say to you, ‘Why are you sighing?’ that you shall answer, ‘Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> water. Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass,’ says the Lord God.”
8 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
9 “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord!’ Say: ‘A sword, a sword is sharpened And also polished!
10 Sharpened to make a dreadful slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, <font color="#999999"><em>As it does</em></font> all wood.
11 And He has given it to be polished, That it may be handled; This sword is sharpened, and it is polished To be given into the hand of the slayer.’
12 “Cry and wail, son of man; For it will be against My people, Against all the princes of Israel. Terrors including the sword will be against My people; Therefore strike <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> thigh.
13 “Because <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> a testing, And what if <font color="#999999"><em>the sword</em></font> despises even the scepter? <font color="#999999"><em>The scepter</em></font> shall be no <font color="#999999"><em>more,</em></font>” says the Lord God.
14 “You therefore, son of man, prophesy, And strike <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> hands together. The third time let the sword do double <font color="#999999"><em>damage.</em></font> It <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the sword <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> slays, The sword that slays the great <font color="#999999"><em>men,</em></font> That enters their private chambers.
15 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> made bright; <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> grasped for slaughter:
16 “Swords at the ready! Thrust right! Set your blade! Thrust left — Wherever your edge is ordered!
17 “I also will beat My fists together, And I will cause My fury to rest; I, the Lord, have spoken.”
18 The word of the Lord came to me again, saying:
19 “And son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to go; both of them shall go from the same land. Make a sign; put <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> at the head of the road to the city.
20 Appoint a road for the sword to go to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.
21 For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the fork of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver.
22 In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a <font color="#999999"><em>siege</em></font> mound, and to build a wall.
23 And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
24 “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear — because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand.
25 ‘Now to you, O profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose iniquity <font color="#999999"><em>shall</em></font> end,
26 thus says the Lord God: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown; Nothing <font color="#999999"><em>shall remain</em></font> the same. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.
27 Overthrown, overthrown, I will make it overthrown! It shall be no <font color="#999999"><em>longer,</em></font> Until He comes whose right it is, And I will give it <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>Him</em></font>.” ’
<br><font color="#999999">A Sword Against the Ammonites</font><br><br>28 “And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach,’ and say: ‘A sword, a sword <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> drawn, Polished for slaughter, For consuming, for flashing —
29 While they see false visions for you, While they divine a lie to you, To bring you on the necks of the wicked, the slain Whose day has come, Whose iniquity <font color="#999999"><em>shall</em></font> end.
30 ‘Return <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> to its sheath. I will judge you In the place where you were created, In the land of your nativity.
31 I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, And deliver you into the hands of brutal men <font color="#999999"><em>who are</em></font> skillful to destroy.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Sins of Jerusalem</font><br><br>1 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Now, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show her all her abominations!
3 Then say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “The city sheds blood in her own midst, that her time may come; and she makes idols within herself to defile herself.
4 You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to <font color="#999999"><em>the end of</em></font> your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all countries.
5 <font color="#999999"><em>Those</em></font> near and <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> far from you will mock you as infamous <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> full of tumult.
6 “Look, the princes of Israel: each one has used his power to shed blood in you.
7 In you they have made light of father and mother; in your midst they have oppressed the stranger; in you they have mistreated the fatherless and the widow.
8 You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.
9 In you are men who slander to cause bloodshed; in you are those who eat on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness.
10 In you men uncover their fathers’ nakedness; in you they violate women who are set apart during their impurity.
11 One commits abomination with his neighbor’s wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; and another in you violates his sister, his father’s daughter.
12 In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take usury and increase; you have made profit from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten Me,” says the Lord God.
13 “Behold, therefore, I beat My fists at the dishonest profit which you have made, and at the bloodshed which has been in your midst.
14 Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when I shall deal with you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and will do <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
15 I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the countries, and remove your filthiness completely from you.
16 You shall defile yourself in the sight of the nations; then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.” ’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">Israel in the Furnace</font><br><br>17 The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of a furnace; they have become dross from silver.
19 Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
20 <font color="#999999"><em>As men</em></font> gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of a furnace, to blow fire on it, to melt <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> so I will gather <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave <font color="#999999"><em>you there</em></font> and melt you.
21 Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst.
22 As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst; then you shall know that I, the Lord, have poured out My fury on you.’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">Israel’s Wicked Leaders</font><br><br>23 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
24 “Son of man, say to her: ‘You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.’
25 The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured people; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
26 Her priests have violated My law and profaned My holy things; they have not distinguished between the holy and unholy, nor have they made known <font color="#999999"><em>the difference</em></font> between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
27 Her princes in her midst <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy people, and to get dishonest gain.
28 Her prophets plastered them with untempered <font color="#999999"><em>mortar,</em></font> seeing false visions, and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ when the Lord had not spoken.
29 The people of the land have used oppressions, committed robbery, and mistreated the poor and needy; and they wrongfully oppress the stranger.
30 So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.
31 Therefore I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; and I have recompensed their deeds on their own heads,” says the Lord God.

<br><font color="#999999">Two Harlot Sisters</font><br><br>1 The word of the Lord came again to me, saying:
2 “Son of man, there were two women, The daughters of one mother.
3 They committed harlotry in Egypt, They committed harlotry in their youth; Their breasts were there embraced, Their virgin bosom was there pressed.
4 Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister; They were Mine, And they bore sons and daughters. <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> their names, Samaria <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Oholah, and Jerusalem <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Oholibah.
<br><font color="#999999">The Older Sister, Samaria</font><br><br>5 “Oholah played the harlot even though she was Mine; And she lusted for her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,
6 <font color="#999999"><em>Who were</em></font> clothed in purple, Captains and rulers, All of them desirable young men, Horsemen riding on horses.
7 Thus she committed her harlotry with them, All of them choice men of Assyria; And with all for whom she lusted, With all their idols, she defiled herself.
8 She has never given up her harlotry <font color="#999999"><em>brought</em></font> from Egypt, For in her youth they had lain with her, Pressed her virgin bosom, And poured out their immorality upon her.
9 “Therefore I have delivered her Into the hand of her lovers, Into the hand of the Assyrians, For whom she lusted.
10 They uncovered her nakedness, Took away her sons and daughters, And slew her with the sword; She became a byword among women, For they had executed judgment on her.
<br><font color="#999999">The Younger Sister, Jerusalem</font><br><br>11 “Now although her sister Oholibah saw <font color="#999999"><em>this,</em></font> she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotry more corrupt than her sister’s harlotry.
12 “She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians, Captains and rulers, Clothed most gorgeously, Horsemen riding on horses, All of them desirable young men.
13 Then I saw that she was defiled; Both <font color="#999999"><em>took</em></font> the same way.
14 But she increased her harlotry; She looked at men portrayed on the wall, Images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
15 Girded with belts around their waists, Flowing turbans on their heads, All of them looking like captains, In the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, The land of their nativity.
16 As soon as her eyes saw them, She lusted for them And sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
17 “Then the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, And they defiled her with their immorality; So she was defiled by them, and alienated herself from them.
18 She revealed her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness. Then I alienated Myself from her, As I had alienated Myself from her sister.
19 “Yet she multiplied her harlotry In calling to remembrance the days of her youth, When she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
20 For she lusted for her paramours, Whose flesh <font color="#999999"><em>is like</em></font> the flesh of donkeys, And whose issue <font color="#999999"><em>is like</em></font> the issue of horses.
21 Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, When the Egyptians pressed your bosom Because of your youthful breasts.
<br><font color="#999999">Judgment on Jerusalem</font><br><br>22 “Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, From whom you have alienated yourself, And I will bring them against you from every side:
23 The Babylonians, All the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, All the Assyrians with them, All of them desirable young men, Governors and rulers, Captains and men of renown, All of them riding on horses.
24 And they shall come against you With chariots, wagons, and war-horses, With a horde of people. They shall array against you Buckler, shield, and helmet all around. ‘I will delegate judgment to them, And they shall judge you according to their judgments.
25 I will set My jealousy against you, And they shall deal furiously with you; They shall remove your nose and your ears, And your remnant shall fall by the sword; They shall take your sons and your daughters, And your remnant shall be devoured by fire.
26 They shall also strip you of your clothes And take away your beautiful jewelry.
27 ‘Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry <font color="#999999"><em>Brought</em></font> from the land of Egypt, So that you will not lift your eyes to them, Nor remember Egypt anymore.’
28 “For thus says the Lord God: ‘Surely I will deliver you into the hand of those you hate, into the hand <font color="#999999"><em>of those</em></font> from whom you alienated yourself.
29 They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotry.
30 I will do these <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> to you because you have gone as a harlot after the Gentiles, because you have become defiled by their idols.
31 You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup in your hand.’
32 “Thus says the Lord God: ‘You shall drink of your sister’s cup, The deep and wide one; You shall be laughed to scorn And held in derision; It contains much.
33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria.
34 You shall drink and drain it, You shall break its shards, And tear at your own breasts; For I have spoken,’ Says the Lord God.
35 “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, Therefore you shall bear the <font color="#999999"><em>penalty</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>Of</em></font> your lewdness and your harlotry.’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">Both Sisters Judged</font><br><br>36 The Lord also said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
37 For they have committed adultery, and blood <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and even <font color="#999999"><em>sacrificed</em></font> their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through <font color="#999999"><em>the fire,</em></font> to devour <font color="#999999"><em>them.</em></font>
38 Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and profaned My Sabbaths.
39 For after they had slain their children for their idols, on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and indeed thus they have done in the midst of My house.
40 “Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.
41 You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.
42 The sound of a carefree multitude <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> with her, and Sabeans <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.
43 Then I said concerning <font color="#999999"><em>her who had grown</em></font> old in adulteries, ‘Will they commit harlotry with her now, and she <font color="#999999"><em>with them?</em></font>’
44 Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman who plays the harlot; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women.
45 But righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women who shed blood, because they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> adulteresses, and blood <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on their hands.
46 “For thus says the Lord God: ‘Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to trouble and plunder.
47 The assembly shall stone them with stones and execute them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
48 Thus I will cause lewdness to cease from the land, that all women may be taught not to practice your lewdness.
49 They shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous sins. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord God.’ ”

<br><font color="#999999">Symbol of the Cooking Pot</font><br><br>1 Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day — the king of Babylon started his siege against Jerusalem this very day.
3 And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Put on a pot, set <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> on, And also pour water into it.
4 Gather pieces <font color="#999999"><em>of meat</em></font> in it, Every good piece, The thigh and the shoulder. Fill <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with choice cuts;
5 Take the choice of the flock. Also pile <font color="#999999"><em>fuel</em></font> bones under it, Make it boil well, And let the cuts simmer in it.”
6 ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Woe to the bloody city, To the pot whose scum <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in it, And whose scum is not gone from it! Bring it out piece by piece, On which no lot has fallen.
7 For her blood is in her midst; She set it on top of a rock; She did not pour it on the ground, To cover it with dust.
8 That it may raise up fury and take vengeance, I have set her blood on top of a rock, That it may not be covered.”
9 ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Woe to the bloody city! I too will make the pyre great.
10 Heap on the wood, Kindle the fire; Cook the meat well, Mix in the spices, And let the cuts be burned up.
11 “Then set the pot empty on the coals, That it may become hot and its bronze may burn, <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> its filthiness may be melted in it, <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> its scum may be consumed.
12 She has grown weary with lies, And her great scum has not gone from her. <font color="#999999"><em>Let</em></font> her scum <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> in the fire!
13 In your filthiness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, You will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, Till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.
14 I, the Lord, have spoken <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> It shall come to pass, and I will do <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> I will not hold back, Nor will I spare, Nor will I relent; According to your ways And according to your deeds They will judge you,” Says the Lord God.’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">The Prophet’s Wife Dies</font><br><br>15 Also the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
16 “Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down.
17 Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> lips, and do not eat man’s bread <font color="#999999"><em>of sorrow.</em></font>”
18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and the next morning I did as I was commanded.
19 And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these <font color="#999999"><em>things signify</em></font> to us, that you behave so?”
20 Then I answered them, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
21 ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, your arrogant boast, the desire of your eyes, the delight of your soul; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> lips nor eat man’s bread <font color="#999999"><em>of sorrow.</em></font>

3 Indeed Assyria <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a cedar in Lebanon, With fine branches that shaded the forest, And of high stature; And its top was among the thick boughs.
4 The waters made it grow; Underground waters gave it height, With their rivers running around the place where it was planted, And sent out rivulets to all the trees of the field.
5 ‘Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field; Its boughs were multiplied, And its branches became long because of the abundance of water, As it sent them out.
6 All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; Under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; And in its shadow all great nations made their home.
7 ‘Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches, Because its roots reached to abundant waters.
8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; The fir trees were not like its boughs, And the chestnut trees were not like its branches; No tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.
9 I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches, So that all the trees of Eden envied it, That <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in the garden of God.’
10 “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and its heart was lifted up in its height,
11 therefore I will deliver it into the hand of the mighty one of the nations, and he shall surely deal with it; I have driven it out for its wickedness.
12 And aliens, the most terrible of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it.
13 ‘On its ruin will remain all the birds of the heavens, And all the beasts of the field will come to its branches —
14 So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them. ‘For they have all been delivered to death, To the depths of the earth, Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.’
15 “Thus says the Lord God: ‘In the day when it went down to hell, I caused mourning. I covered the deep because of it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it.
16 I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to hell together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth.
17 They also went down to hell with it, with those slain by the sword; and <font color="#999999"><em>those who were</em></font> its <font color="#999999"><em>strong</em></font> arm dwelt in its shadows among the nations.
18 ‘To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> slain by the sword. This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Pharaoh and all his multitude,’ says the Lord God.”

3 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will therefore spread My net over you with a company of many people, And they will draw you up in My net.
4 Then I will leave you on the land; I will cast you out on the open fields, And cause to settle on you all the birds of the heavens. And with you I will fill the beasts of the whole earth.
5 I will lay your flesh on the mountains, And fill the valleys with your carcass.
6 “I will also water the land with the flow of your blood, <font color="#999999"><em>Even</em></font> to the mountains; And the riverbeds will be full of you.
7 When <font color="#999999"><em>I</em></font> put out your light, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, And the moon shall not give her light.
8 All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, And bring darkness upon your land,” Says the Lord God.
9 ‘I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.
10 Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble <font color="#999999"><em>every</em></font> moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.
11 ‘For thus says the Lord God: “The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
12 By the swords of the mighty warriors, all of them the most terrible of the nations, I will cause your multitude to fall. “They shall plunder the pomp of Egypt, And all its multitude shall be destroyed.
13 Also I will destroy all its animals From beside its great waters; The foot of man shall muddy them no more, Nor shall the hooves of animals muddy them.
14 Then I will make their waters clear, And make their rivers run like oil,” Says the Lord God.
15 “When I make the land of Egypt desolate, And the country is destitute of all that once filled it, When I strike all who dwell in it, Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.
16 “This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the lamentation With which they shall lament her; The daughters of the nations shall lament her; They shall lament for her, for Egypt, And for all her multitude,” Says the Lord God.’ ”

18 “Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, And cast them down to the depths of the earth, Her and the daughters of the famous nations, With those who go down to the Pit:
19 ‘Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, be placed with the uncircumcised.’
20 “They shall fall in the midst of <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> slain by the sword; She is delivered to the sword, Drawing her and all her multitudes.
21 The strong among the mighty Shall speak to him out of the midst of hell With those who help him: ‘They have gone down, They lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.’
22 “Assyria <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> there, and all her company, With their graves all around her, All of them slain, fallen by the sword.
23 Her graves are set in the recesses of the Pit, And her company is all around her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword, Who caused terror in the land of the living.
24 “There <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Elam and all her multitude, All around her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword, Who have gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, Who caused their terror in the land of the living; Now they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.
25 They have set her bed in the midst of the slain, With all her multitude, With her graves all around it, All of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; Though their terror was caused In the land of the living, Yet they bear their shame With those who go down to the Pit; It was put in the midst of the slain.
26 “There <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> Meshech and Tubal and all their multitudes, With all their graves around it, All of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, Though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
27 They do not lie with the mighty <font color="#999999"><em>Who are</em></font> fallen of the uncircumcised, Who have gone down to hell with their weapons of war; They have laid their swords under their heads, But their iniquities will be on their bones, Because of the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
28 Yes, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, And lie with <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> slain by the sword.
29 “There <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> Edom, Her kings and all her princes, Who despite their might Are laid beside <font color="#999999"><em>those</em></font> slain by the sword; They shall lie with the uncircumcised, And with those who go down to the Pit.

<br><font color="#999999">The Watchman and His Message</font><br><br>1 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their territory and make him their watchman,
3 when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people,
4 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his <font color="#999999"><em>own</em></font> head.
5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his life.
6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’
7 “So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me.
8 When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man,</em></font> you shall surely die!’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.
9 Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
10 “Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘Thus you say, “If our transgressions and our sins <font color="#999999"><em>lie</em></font> upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live?” ’
11 Say to them: ‘<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’
<br><font color="#999999">The Fairness of God’s Judgment</font><br><br>12 “Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of <font color="#999999"><em>his righteousness</em></font> in the day that he sins.’
13 When I say to the righteous <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> he shall surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die.
14 Again, when I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ if he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right,
15 <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
16 None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
17 “Yet the children of your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ But it is their way which is not fair!
18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it.
19 But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right, he shall live because of it.
20 Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his own ways.”
<br><font color="#999999">The Fall of Jerusalem</font><br><br>21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the fifth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has been captured!”
22 Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
<br><font color="#999999">The Cause of Judah’s Ruin</font><br><br>23 Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
24 “Son of man, they who inhabit those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, and he inherited the land. But we <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> many; the land has been given to us as a possession.’
25 “Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “You eat <font color="#999999"><em>meat</em></font> with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land?
26 You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile one another’s wives. Should you then possess the land?” ’
27 “Say thus to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live, surely those who <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence.
28 For I will make the land most desolate, her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through.
29 Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.” ’
<br><font color="#999999">Hearing and Not Doing</font><br><br>30 “As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes from the Lord.’
31 So they come to you as people do, they sit before you <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> their hearts pursue their <font color="#999999"><em>own</em></font> gain.
32 Indeed you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them.
33 And when this comes to pass — surely it will come — then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”

<br><font color="#999999">Irresponsible Shepherds</font><br><br>1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God to the shepherds: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
3 You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> you do not feed the flock.
4 The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them.
5 So they were scattered because <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.
6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching <font color="#999999"><em>for them.</em></font>”
7 ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
8 “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live,” says the Lord God, “surely because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food for every beast of the field, because <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock” —
9 therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the Lord!
10 Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hand; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep, and the shepherds shall feed themselves no more; for I will deliver My flock from their mouths, that they may no longer be food for them.”
<br><font color="#999999">God, the True Shepherd</font><br><br>11 ‘For thus says the Lord God: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.
12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.
13 And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country.
14 I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
15 I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down,” says the Lord God.
16 “I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them in judgment.”
17 ‘And <font color="#999999"><em>as for</em></font> you, O My flock, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats.
18 <font color="#999999"><em>Is it</em></font> too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture — and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the residue with your feet?
19 And <font color="#999999"><em>as for</em></font> My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.”
20 ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God to them: “Behold, I Myself will judge between the fat and the lean sheep.
21 Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, butted all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad,
22 therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
23 I will establish one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them — My servant David. He shall feed them and be their shepherd.
24 And I, the Lord, will be their God, and My servant David a prince among them; I, the Lord, have spoken.
25 “I will make a covenant of peace with them, and cause wild beasts to cease from the land; and they will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
26 I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing; and I will cause showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing.
27 Then the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
28 And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> afraid.
29 I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they shall no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the shame of the Gentiles anymore.

9 I will make you perpetually desolate, and your cities shall be uninhabited; then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.

25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.
26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do <font color="#999999"><em>them.</em></font>
28 Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God.
29 I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you.
30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations.
31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations.
32 Not for your sake do I do <font color="#999999"><em>this,</em></font>” says the Lord God, “let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!”
33 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt.
34 The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.
35 So they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities <font color="#999999"><em>are now</em></font> fortified <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> inhabited.’
36 Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> planted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> and I will do <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>”
37 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock.
38 Like a flock <font color="#999999"><em>offered as</em></font> holy <font color="#999999"><em>sacrifices,</em></font> like the flock at Jerusalem on its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.” ’ ”

<br><font color="#999999">The Dry Bones Live</font><br><br>1 The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> full of bones.
2 Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> very many in the open valley; and indeed <font color="#999999"><em>they were</em></font> very dry.
3 And He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” So I answered, “O Lord God, You know.”
4 Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
5 Thus says the Lord God to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
6 I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord.” ’ ”
7 So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone.
8 Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no breath in them.
9 Also He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ ”
10 So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.
11 Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They indeed say, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!’
12 Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
13 Then you shall know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves.
14 I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> and performed <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font>” says the Lord.’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">One Kingdom, One King</font><br><br>15 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
16 “As for you, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: ‘For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> all the house of Israel, his companions.’
17 Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand.
18 “And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you not show us what you <font color="#999999"><em>mean</em></font> by these?’ —
19 say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Surely I will take the stick of Joseph, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.” ’
20 And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
21 “Then say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Surely I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;
22 and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again.
23 They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. Then they shall be My people, and I will be their God.
24 “David My servant <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments and observe My statutes, and do them.
25 Then they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, where your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell there, they, their children, and their children’s children, forever; and My servant David <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> their prince forever.
26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
27 My tabernacle also shall be with them; indeed I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

<br><font color="#999999">Gog and Allies Attack Israel</font><br><br>1 Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

9 You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you.”
10 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On that day it shall come to pass <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will make an evil plan:

12 to take plunder and to take booty, to stretch out your hand against the waste places <font color="#999999"><em>that are again</em></font> inhabited, and against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell in the midst of the land.
13 Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, ‘Have you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?’ ” ’
14 “Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know <font color="#999999"><em>it?</em></font>

<br><font color="#999999">A New City, a New Temple</font><br><br>1 In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on the very same day the hand of the Lord was upon me; and He took me there.
2 In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain; on it toward the south <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> something like the structure of a city.
3 He took me there, and behold, <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> a man whose appearance <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway.
4 And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> brought here so that I might show <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.”
5 Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple. In the man’s hand was a measuring rod six cubits <font color="#999999"><em>long, each being a</em></font> cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.
<br><font color="#999999">The Eastern Gateway of the Temple</font><br><br>6 Then he went to the gateway which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, <font color="#999999"><em>which was</em></font> one rod wide, and the other threshold <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one rod wide.
7 Each gate chamber <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers <font color="#999999"><em>was a space of</em></font> five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one rod.
8 He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod.
9 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts, two cubits. The vestibule of the gate <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> on the inside.
10 In the eastern gateway <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> three gate chambers on one side and three on the other; the three <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> all the same size; also the gateposts were of the same size on this side and that side.
11 He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
12 <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> a space in front of the gate chambers, one cubit <font color="#999999"><em>on this side</em></font> and one cubit on that side; the gate chambers <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.
13 Then he measured the gateway from the roof of <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> gate chamber to the roof of the other; the width <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> twenty-five cubits, as door faces door.
14 He measured the gateposts, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gateway <font color="#999999"><em>extended</em></font> to the gatepost.
15 <font color="#999999"><em>From</em></font> the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> fifty cubits.
16 <font color="#999999"><em>There were</em></font> beveled window <font color="#999999"><em>frames</em></font> in the gate chambers and in their intervening archways on the inside of the gateway all around, and likewise in the vestibules. <font color="#999999"><em>There were</em></font> windows all around on the inside. And on each gatepost <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> palm trees.
<br><font color="#999999">The Outer Court</font><br><br>17 Then he brought me into the outer court; and <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> chambers and a pavement made all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
18 The pavement was by the side of the gateways, corresponding to the length of the gateways; <font color="#999999"><em>this was</em></font> the lower pavement.
19 Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.
<br><font color="#999999">The Northern Gateway</font><br><br>20 On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width.

22 Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, <font color="#999999"><em>had</em></font> the same measurements as the gateway facing east; it was ascended by seven steps, and its archway <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in front of it.
23 A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the eastern <font color="#999999"><em>gateway;</em></font> and he measured from gateway to gateway, one hundred cubits.
<br><font color="#999999">The Southern Gateway</font><br><br>24 After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements.

26 Seven steps led up to it, and its archway <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in front of them; and it had palm trees on its gateposts, one on this side and one on that side.
27 <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> also a gateway on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gateway to gateway toward the south, one hundred cubits.
<br><font color="#999999">Gateways of the Inner Court</font><br><br>28 Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gateway; he measured the southern gateway according to these same measurements.
29 Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> according to these same measurements; <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> windows in it and in its archways all around; <font color="#999999"><em>it was</em></font> fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
30 <font color="#999999"><em>There were</em></font> archways all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
31 Its archways faced the outer court, palm trees <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> on its gateposts, and going up to it <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> eight steps.
32 And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gateway according to these same measurements.
33 Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> according to these same measurements; and <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> windows in it and in its archways all around; <font color="#999999"><em>it was</em></font> fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
34 Its archways faced the outer court, and palm trees <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> on its gateposts on this side and on that side; and going up to it <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> eight steps.
35 Then he brought me to the north gateway and measured <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> according to these same measurements —
36 also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways. It had windows all around; its length <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.
37 Its gateposts faced the outer court, palm trees <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> on its gateposts on this side and on that side, and going up to it <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> eight steps.

40 At the outer side of the <font color="#999999"><em>vestibule</em></font>, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gateway, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gateway <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> two tables.
41 Four tables <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gateway, eight tables on which they slaughtered <font color="#999999"><em>the sacrifices.</em></font>
42 <font color="#999999"><em>There were</em></font> also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
43 Inside <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> on the tables.
<br><font color="#999999">Chambers for Singers and Priests</font><br><br>44 Outside the inner gate <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one facing south at the side of the northern gateway, and the other facing north at the side of the southern gateway.
45 Then he said to me, “This chamber which faces south <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for the priests who have charge of the temple.
46 The chamber which faces north <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for the priests who have charge of the altar; these <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near the Lord to minister to Him.”
<br><font color="#999999">Dimensions of the Inner Court and Vestibule</font><br><br>47 And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. The altar <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in front of the temple.
48 Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts of the vestibule, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.
49 The length of the vestibule <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> pillars by the doorposts, one on this side and another on that side.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Dimensions of the Sanctuary</font><br><br>1 Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the doorposts, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side — the width of the tabernacle.
2 The width of the entryway <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.
3 Also he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits <font color="#999999"><em>high;</em></font> and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.
4 He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, “This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the Most Holy <font color="#999999"><em>Place.</em></font>”
<br><font color="#999999">The Side Chambers on the Wall</font><br><br>5 Next, he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits. The width of each side chamber all around the temple <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> four cubits on every side.
6 The side chambers <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers in each story; they rested on ledges which <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> for the side chambers all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the temple.
7 As one went up from story to story, the side chambers became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> the lowest <font color="#999999"><em>story</em></font> to the highest by way of the middle one.
8 I also saw an elevation all around the temple; it was the foundation of the side chambers, a full rod, <font color="#999999"><em>that is,</em></font> six cubits <font color="#999999"><em>high.</em></font>
9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> five cubits, and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the temple.
10 And between <font color="#999999"><em>it and</em></font> the <font color="#999999"><em>wall</em></font> chambers was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
11 The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the terrace <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> five cubits all around.
<br><font color="#999999">The Building at the Western End</font><br><br>12 The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
<br><font color="#999999">Dimensions and Design of the Temple Area</font><br><br>13 So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separating courtyard with the building and its walls <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one hundred cubits long;
14 also the width of the eastern face of the temple, including the separating courtyard, <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one hundred cubits.
15 He measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separating courtyard, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court,
16 their doorposts and the beveled window frames. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows — the windows were covered —
17 from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.
18 And <font color="#999999"><em>it was</em></font> made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. <font color="#999999"><em>Each</em></font> cherub had two faces,
19 so that the face of a man <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus <font color="#999999"><em>it was</em></font> made throughout the temple all around.
20 From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the sanctuary, cherubim and palm trees <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> carved.
21 The doorposts of the temple <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> square, <font color="#999999"><em>as was</em></font> the front of the sanctuary; their appearance was similar.
22 The altar <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> of wood; and he said to me, “This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the table that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> before the Lord.”
23 The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
24 The doors had two panels <font color="#999999"><em>apiece,</em></font> two folding panels: two <font color="#999999"><em>panels</em></font> for one door and two panels for the other <font color="#999999"><em>door.</em></font>
25 Cherubim and palm trees <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> carved on the doors of the temple just as they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> carved on the walls. A wooden canopy <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> on the front of the vestibule outside.
26 <font color="#999999"><em>There were</em></font> beveled window <font color="#999999"><em>frames</em></font> and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the vestibule — also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Chambers for the Priests</font><br><br>1 Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber which <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> opposite the separating courtyard, and which <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> opposite the building toward the north.
2 Facing the length, <font color="#999999"><em>which was</em></font> one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door.
3 Opposite the inner court of twenty <font color="#999999"><em>cubits,</em></font> and opposite the pavement of the outer court, <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> gallery against gallery in three <font color="#999999"><em>stories.</em></font>
4 In front of the chambers, toward the inside, <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a walk ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north.
5 Now the upper chambers <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> shorter, because the galleries took away <font color="#999999"><em>space</em></font> from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building.
6 For they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in three <font color="#999999"><em>stories</em></font> and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore <font color="#999999"><em>the upper level</em></font> was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up.
7 And a wall which <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> fifty cubits.
8 The length of the chambers toward the outer court <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one hundred cubits.
9 At the lower chambers <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.
10 Also <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building.
11 <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> a walk in front of them also, and their appearance <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like the chambers which <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> toward the north; they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> according to plan.
12 And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> facing south, as one enters them, <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> a door in front of the walk, the way directly in front of the wall toward the east.
13 Then he said to me, “The north chambers <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> the south chambers, which <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> opposite the separating courtyard, <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings — the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering — for the place <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> holy.
14 When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy <font color="#999999"><em>chamber</em></font> into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> for the people.”
<br><font color="#999999">Outer Dimensions of the Temple</font><br><br>15 Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the east, and measured it all around.
16 He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.
17 He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.
18 He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod.
19 He came around to the west side <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.
20 He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the common.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Temple, the Lord’s Dwelling Place</font><br><br>1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east.
2 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.
3 <font color="#999999"><em>It was</em></font> like the appearance of the vision which I saw — like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.
4 And the glory of the Lord came into the temple by way of the gate which faces toward the east.
5 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
6 Then I heard <font color="#999999"><em>Him</em></font> speaking to me from the temple, while a man stood beside me.
7 And He said to me, “Son of man, <font color="#999999"><em>this is</em></font> the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places.
8 When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they defiled My holy name by the abominations which they committed; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.
9 Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.
10 “Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
11 And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and perform them.
12 This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the law of the temple: The whole area surrounding the mountaintop <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> most holy. Behold, this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the law of the temple.
<br><font color="#999999">Dimensions of the Altar</font><br><br>13 “These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the height of the altar:
14 from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> cubit.
15 The altar hearth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth.
16 The altar hearth <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> twelve <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> long, twelve wide, square at its four corners;
17 the ledge, fourteen <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps face toward the east.”
<br><font color="#999999">Consecrating the Altar</font><br><br>18 And He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord God: ‘These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.
19 You shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me,’ says the Lord God.
20 ‘You shall take some of its blood and put <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
21 Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it in the appointed place of the temple, outside the sanctuary.
22 On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with the bull.
23 When you have finished cleansing <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> you shall offer a young bull without blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish.
24 When you offer them before the Lord, the priests shall throw salt on them, and they will offer them up <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a burnt offering to the Lord.
25 Every day for seven days you shall prepare a goat <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> a sin offering; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without blemish.
26 Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
27 When these days are over it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you,’ says the Lord God.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">The East Gate and the Prince</font><br><br>1 Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east, but it <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> shut.
2 And the Lord said to me, “This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because the Lord God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut.
3 <font color="#999999"><em>As for</em></font> the prince, <font color="#999999"><em>because</em></font> he <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway, and go out the same way.”
<br><font color="#999999">Those Admitted to the Temple</font><br><br>4 Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; so I looked, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord; and I fell on my face.
5 And the Lord said to me, “Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and all its laws. Mark well who may enter the house and all who go out from the sanctuary.
6 “Now say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “O house of Israel, let Us have no more of all your abominations.
7 When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it — My house — and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations.
8 And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set <font color="#999999"><em>others</em></font> to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.”
9 Thus says the Lord God: “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any foreigner who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> among the children of Israel.
<br><font color="#999999">Laws Governing Priests</font><br><br>10 “And the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who strayed away from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
11 Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand in an oath against them,” says the Lord God, “that they shall bear their iniquity.
13 And they shall not come near Me to minister to Me as priest, nor come near any of My holy things, nor into the Most Holy <font color="#999999"><em>Place;</em></font> but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.
14 Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the temple, for all its work, and for all that has to be done in it.
15 “But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood,” says the Lord God.
16 “They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to minister to Me, and they shall keep My charge.
17 And it shall be, whenever they enter the gates of the inner court, that they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they minister within the gates of the inner court or within the house.
18 They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their bodies; they shall not clothe themselves with <font color="#999999"><em>anything that causes</em></font> sweat.
19 When they go out to the outer court, to the outer court to the people, they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy chambers, and put on other garments; and in their holy garments they shall not sanctify the people.
20 “They shall neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long, but they shall keep their hair well trimmed.
21 No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court.
22 They shall not take as wife a widow or a divorced woman, but take virgins of the descendants of the house of Israel, or widows of priests.
23 “And they shall teach My people <font color="#999999"><em>the difference</em></font> between the holy and the unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
24 In controversy they shall stand as judges, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> judge it according to My judgments. They shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed meetings, and they shall hallow My Sabbaths.
25 “They shall not defile <font color="#999999"><em>themselves</em></font> by coming near a dead person. Only for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister may they defile themselves.
26 After he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him.
27 And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering in the inner court,” says the Lord God.
28 “It shall be, in regard to their inheritance, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> their inheritance. You shall give them no possession in Israel, for I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> their possession.
29 They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
30 The best of all firstfruits of any kind, and every sacrifice of any kind from all your sacrifices, shall be the priest’s; also you shall give to the priest the first of your ground meal, to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
31 The priests shall not eat anything, bird or beast, that died naturally or was torn <font color="#999999"><em>by wild beasts.</em></font>

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Holy District</font><br><br>1 “Moreover, when you divide the land by lot into inheritance, you shall set apart a district for the Lord, a holy section of the land; its length <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits,</em></font> and the width ten thousand. It <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> holy throughout its territory all around.
2 Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by five hundred <font color="#999999"><em>rods,</em></font> with fifty cubits around it for an open space.
3 So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> long and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy <font color="#999999"><em>Place.</em></font>
4 It shall be a holy <font color="#999999"><em>section</em></font> of the land, belonging to the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the Lord; it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
5 <font color="#999999"><em>An area</em></font> twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> long and ten thousand wide shall belong to the Levites, the ministers of the temple; they shall have twenty chambers as a possession.
<br><font color="#999999">Properties of the City and the Prince</font><br><br>6 “You shall appoint as the property of the city <font color="#999999"><em>an area</em></font> five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> wide and twenty-five thousand long, adjacent to the district of the holy <font color="#999999"><em>section;</em></font> it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
7 “The prince shall have <font color="#999999"><em>a section</em></font> on one side and the other of the holy district and the city’s property; and bordering on the holy district and the city’s property, extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side, the length <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> side by side with one of the <font color="#999999"><em>tribal</em></font> portions, from the west border to the east border.
8 The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My princes shall no more oppress My people, but they shall give <font color="#999999"><em>the rest of</em></font> the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.”
<br><font color="#999999">Laws Governing the Prince</font><br><br>9 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Enough, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people,” says the Lord God.
10 “You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.
11 The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer.
12 The shekel <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> fifteen shekels shall be your mina.
13 “This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the offering which you shall offer: you shall give one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.
14 The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> one-tenth of a bath from a kor. <font color="#999999"><em>A kor is</em></font> a homer or ten baths, for ten baths <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a homer.
15 And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred, from the rich pastures of Israel. These shall be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them,” says the Lord God.
16 “All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.
17 Then it shall be the prince’s part <font color="#999999"><em>to give</em></font> burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the New Moons, the Sabbaths, and at all the appointed seasons of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.”
<br><font color="#999999">Keeping the Feasts</font><br><br>18 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “In the first <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the first <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary.
19 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the gate of the inner court.
20 And so you shall do on the seventh <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month for everyone who has sinned unintentionally or in ignorance. Thus you shall make atonement for the temple.
21 “In the first <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
22 And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> a sin offering.
23 On the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish, daily for seven days, and a kid of the goats daily <font color="#999999"><em>for</em></font> a sin offering.
24 And he shall prepare a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one ephah for each ram, together with a hin of oil for each ephah.
25 “In the seventh <font color="#999999"><em>month,</em></font> on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Manner of Worship</font><br><br>1 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “The gateway of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened.
2 The prince shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the entrance to this gateway before the Lord on the Sabbaths and the New Moons.
4 The burnt offering that the prince offers to the Lord on the Sabbath day <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish;
5 and the grain offering <font color="#999999"><em>shall be one</em></font> ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, as much as he wants to give, as well as a hin of oil with every ephah.
6 On the day of the New Moon <font color="#999999"><em>it shall be</em></font> a young bull without blemish, six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish.
7 He shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as much as he wants to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.
8 When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the vestibule of the gateway, and go out the same way.
9 “But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the appointed feast days, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate.
10 The prince shall then be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.
11 At the festivals and the appointed feast days the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as much as he wants to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.
12 “Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to the Lord, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened for him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.
13 “You shall daily make a burnt offering to the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>of</em></font> a lamb of the first year without blemish; you shall prepare it every morning.
14 And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance, to be made regularly to the Lord.
15 Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a regular burnt offering every morning.”
<br><font color="#999999">The Prince and Inheritance Laws</font><br><br>16 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “If the prince gives a gift <font color="#999999"><em>of some</em></font> of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
17 But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs.
18 Moreover the prince shall not take any of the people’s inheritance by evicting them from their property; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people may be scattered from his property.” ’ ”
<br><font color="#999999">How the Offerings Were Prepared</font><br><br>19 Now he brought me through the entrance, which <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests which face toward the north; and there a place <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> situated at their extreme western end.
20 And he said to me, “This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> out into the outer court to sanctify the people.”
21 Then he brought me out into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and in fact, in every corner of the court <font color="#999999"><em>there was another</em></font> court.
22 In the four corners of the court <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> enclosed courts, forty <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> long and thirty wide; all four corners <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> the same size.
23 <font color="#999999"><em>There was</em></font> a row <font color="#999999"><em>of building stones</em></font> all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows of stones all around.
24 And he said to me, “These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the kitchens where the ministers of the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Healing Waters and Trees</font><br><br>1 Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.
2 He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.
3 And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water <font color="#999999"><em>came up to my</em></font> ankles.
4 Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water <font color="#999999"><em>came up to my</em></font> knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water <font color="#999999"><em>came up to my</em></font> waist.
5 Again he measured one thousand, <font color="#999999"><em>and it was</em></font> a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.
6 He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen <font color="#999999"><em>this?</em></font>” Then he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.
7 When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> very many trees on one side and the other.
8 Then he said to me: “This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the valley, and enters the sea. <font color="#999999"><em>When it</em></font> reaches the sea, <font color="#999999"><em>its</em></font> waters are healed.
9 And it shall be <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river goes.
10 It shall be <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be <font color="#999999"><em>places</em></font> for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many.
11 But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.
12 Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all <font color="#999999"><em>kinds of</em></font> trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for medicine.”
<br><font color="#999999">Borders of the Land</font><br><br>13 Thus says the Lord God: “These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph <font color="#999999"><em>shall have two</em></font> portions.
14 You shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand in an oath to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
15 “This <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, <font color="#999999"><em>by</em></font> the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad,
16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the border of Hauran).
17 Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. <font color="#999999"><em>This is</em></font> the north side.
18 “On the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and along the eastern side of the sea. <font color="#999999"><em>This is</em></font> the east side.
19 “The south side, toward the South, <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. <font color="#999999"><em>This is</em></font> the south side, toward the South.
20 “The west side <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> the Great Sea, from the <font color="#999999"><em>southern</em></font> boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the west side.
21 “Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
22 It shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
23 And it shall be <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> in whatever tribe the stranger dwells, there you shall give <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> his inheritance,” says the Lord God.

<br><font color="#999999">Division of the Land</font><br><br>1 “Now these <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath, <font color="#999999"><em>there shall be</em></font> one <font color="#999999"><em>section for</em></font> Dan from its east to its west side;
2 by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one <font color="#999999"><em>section for</em></font> Asher;
3 by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one <font color="#999999"><em>section for</em></font> Naphtali;
4 by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, one <font color="#999999"><em>section for</em></font> Manasseh;

7 by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west, one <font color="#999999"><em>section for</em></font> Judah;
8 by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the district which you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> in width, and <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> length the same as one of the <font color="#999999"><em>other</em></font> portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the center.
9 “The district that you shall set apart for the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> in length and ten thousand in width.
10 To these — to the priests — the holy district shall belong: on the north twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits in length,</em></font> on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. The sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the center.
11 <font color="#999999"><em>It shall be</em></font> for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are sanctified, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
12 And <font color="#999999"><em>this</em></font> district of land that is set apart shall be to them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
13 “Opposite the border of the priests, the Levites <font color="#999999"><em>shall have an area</em></font> twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand.
14 And they shall not sell or exchange any of it; they may not alienate this best <font color="#999999"><em>part</em></font> of the land, for <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> holy to the Lord.
15 “The five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> in width that remain, along the edge of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for general use by the city, for dwellings and common-land; and the city shall be in the center.
16 These <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred <font color="#999999"><em>cubits,</em></font> the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.
17 The common-land of the city shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty <font color="#999999"><em>cubits,</em></font> to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.
18 The rest of the length, alongside the district of the holy <font color="#999999"><em>section, shall be</em></font> ten thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be adjacent to the district of the holy <font color="#999999"><em>section,</em></font> and its produce shall be food for the workers of the city.
19 The workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it.
20 The entire district <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> by twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits,</em></font> foursquare. You shall set apart the holy district with the property of the city.
21 “The rest <font color="#999999"><em>shall belong</em></font> to the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy district and of the city’s property, next to the twenty-five thousand <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font> of the <font color="#999999"><em>holy</em></font> district as far as the eastern border, and westward next to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the <font color="#999999"><em>tribal</em></font> portions; <font color="#999999"><em>it shall belong</em></font> to the prince. It shall be the holy district, and the sanctuary of the temple <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> in the center.
22 Moreover, apart from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city <font color="#999999"><em>which are</em></font> in the midst of what <font color="#999999"><em>belongs</em></font> to the prince, <font color="#999999"><em>the area</em></font> between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince.
23 “As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west, Benjamin <font color="#999999"><em>shall have</em></font> one <font color="#999999"><em>section;</em></font>

29 This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the land which you shall divide by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> their portions,” says the Lord God.
<br><font color="#999999">The Gates of the City and Its Name</font><br><br>30 “These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the exits of the city. On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred <font color="#999999"><em>cubits</em></font>
