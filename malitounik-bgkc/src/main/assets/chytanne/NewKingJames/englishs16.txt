<br><font color="#999999">Nehemiah Prays for His People</font><br><br>1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. It came to pass in the month of Chislev, <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel,
2 that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
3 And they said to me, “The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”
4 So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <font color="#999999"><em>for many</em></font> days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
5 And I said: “I pray, Lord God of heaven, O great and awesome God, <font color="#999999"><em>You</em></font> who keep <font color="#999999"><em>Your</em></font> covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments,
6 please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned.
7 We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.
8 Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations;
9 but <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, <font color="#999999"><em>yet</em></font> I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.’
10 Now these <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand.
11 O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” For I was the king’s cupbearer.

<br><font color="#999999">Nehemiah Sent to Judah</font><br><br>1 And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> wine <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before.
2 Therefore the king said to me, “Why <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your face sad, since you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not sick? This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> nothing but sorrow of heart.” So I became dreadfully afraid,
3 and said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, <font color="#999999"><em>lies</em></font> waste, and its gates are burned with fire?”
4 Then the king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.
5 And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”
6 Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
7 Furthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors <font color="#999999"><em>of the region</em></font> beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah,
8 and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which <font color="#999999"><em>pertains</em></font> to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” And the king granted <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.
9 Then I went to the governors <font color="#999999"><em>in the region</em></font> beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard <font color="#999999"><em>of it,</em></font> they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel.
<br><font color="#999999">Nehemiah Views the Wall of Jerusalem</font><br><br>11 So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
12 Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode.
13 And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire.
14 Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no room for the animal under me to pass.
15 So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.
16 And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.
17 Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in, how Jerusalem <font color="#999999"><em>lies</em></font> waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.”
18 And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to <font color="#999999"><em>this</em></font> good <font color="#999999"><em>work.</em></font>
19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard <font color="#999999"><em>of it,</em></font> they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”
20 So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”

<br><font color="#999999">The Wall Defended Against Enemies</font><br><br>1 But it so happened, when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.
2 And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish — <font color="#999999"><em>stones</em></font> that are burned?”
3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> beside him, and he said, “Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up <font color="#999999"><em>on it,</em></font> he will break down their stone wall.”
4 Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity!
5 Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked <font color="#999999"><em>You</em></font> to anger before the builders.
6 So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its <font color="#999999"><em>height,</em></font> for the people had a mind to work.
7 Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry,
8 and all of them conspired together to come <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> attack Jerusalem and create confusion.
9 Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.
10 Then Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.”
11 And our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.”
12 So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, “From whatever place you turn, <font color="#999999"><em>they will be</em></font> upon us.”
13 Therefore I positioned <font color="#999999"><em>men</em></font> behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
14 And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”
15 And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work.
16 So it was, from that time on, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and <font color="#999999"><em>wore</em></font> armor; and the leaders <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> behind all the house of Judah.
17 Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon.
18 Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> beside me.
19 Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “The work <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall.
20 Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”
21 So we labored in the work, and half of <font color="#999999"><em>the men</em></font> held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared.
22 At the same time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.”
23 So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, <font color="#999999"><em>except</em></font> that everyone took them off for washing.

<br><font color="#999999">Nehemiah Deals with Oppression</font><br><br>1 And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren.
2 For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”
3 There were also <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> who said, “We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.”
4 There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax <font color="#999999"><em>on</em></font> our lands and vineyards.
5 Yet now our flesh <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> of our daughters have been brought into slavery. <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not in our power <font color="#999999"><em>to redeem them,</em></font> for other men have our lands and vineyards.”
6 And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
7 After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, “Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.” So I called a great assembly against them.
8 And I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?” Then they were silenced and found nothing <font color="#999999"><em>to say.</em></font>
9 Then I said, “What you are doing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
10 I also, <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury!
11 Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.”
12 So they said, “We will restore <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.” Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.
13 Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. Then the people did according to this promise.
<br><font color="#999999">The Generosity of Nehemiah</font><br><br>14 Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s provisions.
15 But the former governors who <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.
16 Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> gathered there for the work.
17 And at my table <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us.
18 Now <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> which was prepared daily <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one ox <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor’s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people.
19 Remember me, my God, for good, <font color="#999999"><em>according to</em></font> all that I have done for this people.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Conspiracy Against Nehemiah</font><br><br>1 Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates),
2 that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they thought to do me harm.
3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”
4 But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.
5 Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.
6 In it <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king.
7 And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, “<font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> a king in Judah!” Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.
8 Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.”
9 For they all <font color="#999999"><em>were trying to</em></font> make us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.” Now therefore, <font color="#999999"><em>O God,</em></font> strengthen my hands.
10 Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a secret informer; and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.”
11 And I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!”
12 Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced <font color="#999999"><em>this</em></font> prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
13 For this reason he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> they might have <font color="#999999"><em>cause</em></font> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
14 My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid.
<br><font color="#999999">The Wall Completed</font><br><br>15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of Elul, in fifty-two days.
16 And it happened, when all our enemies heard <font color="#999999"><em>of it,</em></font> and all the nations around us saw <font color="#999999"><em>these things,</em></font> that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God.
17 Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and <font color="#999999"><em>the letters of</em></font> Tobiah came to them.
18 For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
19 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.

<br><font color="#999999">List of Returning Exiles</font><br><br>1 Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,
2 that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the leader of the citadel, for he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a faithful man and feared God more than many.
3 And I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand <font color="#999999"><em>guard,</em></font> let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station and another in front of his own house.”
<br><font color="#999999">The Captives Who Returned to Jerusalem</font><br><br>4 Now the city <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> large and spacious, but the people in it <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> few, and the houses <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> not rebuilt.
5 Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first <font color="#999999"><em>return,</em></font> and found written in it:
6 These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city.

40 the sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two;
41 the sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven;

45 The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.
46 The Nethinim: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,
47 the sons of Keros, the sons of Sia, the sons of Padon,
48 the sons of Lebana, the sons of Hagaba, the sons of <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[m]</i></span>Salmai,
49 the sons of Hanan, the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar,

55 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Tamah,

57 The sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Perida,
58 the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
59 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim, and the sons of Amon.
60 All the Nethinim, and the sons of Solomon’s servants, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> three hundred and ninety-two.
61 And these <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not identify their father’s house nor their lineage, whether they <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> of Israel:
62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two;
63 and of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name.
64 These sought their listing <font color="#999999"><em>among</em></font> those who were registered by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled.
65 And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim.
66 Altogether the whole assembly <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
67 besides their male and female servants, of whom <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five men and women singers.
68 Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,
69 <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> camels four hundred and thirty-five, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
70 And some of the heads of the fathers’ <font color="#999999"><em>houses</em></font> gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand gold drachmas, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priestly garments.
71 Some of the heads of the fathers’ <font color="#999999"><em>houses</em></font> gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand gold drachmas, and two thousand two hundred silver minas.
72 And that which the rest of the people gave <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly garments.
73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> of the people, the Nethinim, and all Israel dwelt in their cities. <br><font color="#999999">Ezra Reads the Law</font><br><br>When the seventh month came, the children of Israel <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in their cities.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Ezra Reads and Explains the Law</font><br><br>1 Now all the people gathered together as one man in the open square that <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in front of the Water Gate; and they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded Israel.
2 So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who <font color="#999999"><em>could</em></font> hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month.
3 Then he read from it in the open square that <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people <font color="#999999"><em>were attentive</em></font> to the Book of the Law.
4 So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Meshullam.
5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was <font color="#999999"><em>standing</em></font> above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
6 And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. Then all the people answered, “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> faces to the ground.
7 Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people <font color="#999999"><em>stood</em></font> in their place.
8 So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> to understand the reading.
9 And Nehemiah, who <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the governor, Ezra the priest <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> holy to the Lord your God; do not mourn nor weep.” For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.
10 Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for <font color="#999999"><em>this</em></font> day <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”
11 So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> holy; do not be grieved.”
12 And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and rejoice greatly, because they understood the words that were declared to them.
<br><font color="#999999">The Feast of Tabernacles</font><br><br>13 Now on the second day the heads of the fathers’ <font color="#999999"><em>houses</em></font> of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to understand the words of the Law.
14 And they found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month,
15 and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and bring olive branches, branches of oil trees, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> written.”
16 Then the people went out and brought <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> and made themselves booths, each one on the roof of his house, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim.
17 So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.
18 Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> a sacred assembly, according to the <font color="#999999"><em>prescribed</em></font> manner.

===
<br><font color="#999999">The People Confess Their Sins</font><br><br>1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, in sackcloth, and with dust on their heads.
2 Then those of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners; and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
3 And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God <font color="#999999"><em>for one</em></font>-fourth of the day; and <font color="#999999"><em>for another</em></font> fourth they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God.
4 Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God.
5 And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Pethahiah, said: “Stand up <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> bless the Lord your God Forever and ever! “Blessed be Your glorious name, Which is exalted above all blessing and praise!
6 You alone <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the Lord; You have made heaven, The heaven of heavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The seas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven worships You.
7 “You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the Lord God, Who chose Abram, And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, And gave him the name Abraham;
8 You found his heart faithful before You, And made a covenant with him To give the land of the Canaanites, The Hittites, the Amorites, The Perizzites, the Jebusites, And the Girgashites — To give <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> to his descendants. You have performed Your words, For You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> righteous.
9 “You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And heard their cry by the Red Sea.
10 You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants, And against all the people of his land. For You knew that they acted proudly against them. So You made a name for Yourself, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> this day.
11 And You divided the sea before them, So that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; And their persecutors You threw into the deep, As a stone into the mighty waters.
12 Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar, And by night with a pillar of fire, To give them light on the road Which they should travel.
13 “You came down also on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven, And gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments.
14 You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, And commanded them precepts, statutes and laws, By the hand of Moses Your servant.
15 You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, And brought them water out of the rock for their thirst, And told them to go in to possess the land Which You had sworn to give them.
16 “But they and our fathers acted proudly, Hardened their necks, And did not heed Your commandments.
17 They refused to obey, And they were not mindful of Your wonders That You did among them. But they hardened their necks, And in their rebellion They appointed a leader To return to their bondage. But You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> God, Ready to pardon, Gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, Abundant in kindness, And did not forsake them.
18 “Even when they made a molded calf for themselves, And said, ‘This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your god That brought you up out of Egypt,’ And worked great provocations,
19 Yet in Your manifold mercies You did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, To lead them on the road; Nor the pillar of fire by night, To show them light, And the way they should go.
20 You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, And did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, And gave them water for their thirst.
21 Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; They lacked nothing; Their clothes did not wear out And their feet did not swell.
22 “Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations, And divided them into districts. So they took possession of the land of Sihon, The land of the king of Heshbon, And the land of Og king of Bashan.
23 You also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, And brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers To go in and possess.
24 So the people went in And possessed the land; You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, The Canaanites, And gave them into their hands, With their kings And the people of the land, That they might do with them as they wished.
25 And they took strong cities and a rich land, And possessed houses full of all goods, Cisterns <font color="#999999"><em>already</em></font> dug, vineyards, olive groves, And fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and grew fat, And delighted themselves in Your great goodness.
26 “Nevertheless they were disobedient And rebelled against You, Cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets, who testified against them To turn them to Yourself; And they worked great provocations.
27 Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, Who oppressed them; And in the time of their trouble, When they cried to You, You heard from heaven; And according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them From the hand of their enemies.
28 “But after they had rest, They again did evil before You. Therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies, So that they had dominion over them; Yet when they returned and cried out to You, You heard from heaven; And many times You delivered them according to Your mercies,
29 And testified against them, That You might bring them back to Your law. Yet they acted proudly, And did not heed Your commandments, But sinned against Your judgments, ‘Which if a man does, he shall live by them.’ And they shrugged their shoulders, <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[o]</i></span>Stiffened their necks, And would not hear.
30 Yet for many years You had patience with them, And testified against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets. Yet they would not listen; Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
31 Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them; For You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> God, gracious and merciful.
32 “Now therefore, our God, The great, the mighty, and awesome God, Who keeps covenant and mercy: Do not let all the trouble seem small before You That has come upon us, Our kings and our princes, Our priests and our prophets, Our fathers and on all Your people, From the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.
33 However You <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> just in all that has befallen us; For You have dealt faithfully, But we have done wickedly.
34 Neither our kings nor our princes, Our priests nor our fathers, Have kept Your law, Nor heeded Your commandments and Your testimonies, With which You testified against them.
35 For they have not served You in their kingdom, Or in the many good <font color="#999999"><em>things</em></font> that You gave them, Or in the large and rich land which You set before them; Nor did they turn from their wicked works.
36 “Here we <font color="#999999"><em>are,</em></font> servants today! And the land that You gave to our fathers, To eat its fruit and its bounty, Here we <font color="#999999"><em>are,</em></font> servants in it!
37 And it yields much increase to the kings You have set over us, Because of our sins; Also they have dominion over our bodies and our cattle At their pleasure; And we <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in great distress.
38 “And because of all this, We make a sure <font color="#999999"><em>covenant</em></font> and write <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> Our leaders, our Levites, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> our priests seal <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>”

<br><font color="#999999">The People Who Sealed the Covenant</font><br><br>1 Now those who placed <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> seal on <font color="#999999"><em>the document were:</em></font> Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,

<br><font color="#999999">The Covenant That Was Sealed</font><br><br>28 Now the rest of the people — the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone who had knowledge and understanding —
29 these joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse and an oath to walk in God’s Law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Lord our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes:
30 We would not give our daughters as wives to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;
31 <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> the peoples of the land brought wares or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and we would forego the seventh year’s <font color="#999999"><em>produce</em></font> and the exacting of every debt.
32 Also we made ordinances for ourselves, to exact from ourselves yearly one-third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
33 for the showbread, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering of the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the set feasts; for the holy things, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God.
34 We cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for bringing the wood offering into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at the appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of the Lord our God as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> written in the Law.
35 And <font color="#999999"><em>we made ordinances</em></font> to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the house of the Lord;
36 to bring the firstborn of our sons and our cattle, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks, to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God;
37 to bring the firstfruits of our dough, our offerings, the fruit from all kinds of trees, <font color="#999999"><em>the</em></font> new wine and oil, to the priests, to the storerooms of the house of our God; and to bring the tithes of our land to the Levites, for the Levites should receive the tithes in all our farming communities.
38 And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes; and the Levites shall bring up a tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms of the storehouse.
39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine and the oil, to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary <font color="#999999"><em>are, where</em></font> the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and the singers <font color="#999999"><em>are;</em></font> and we will not neglect the house of our God.

<br><font color="#999999">The People Dwelling in Jerusalem</font><br><br>1 Now the leaders of the people dwelt at Jerusalem; the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine-tenths <font color="#999999"><em>were to dwell</em></font> in <font color="#999999"><em>other</em></font> cities.
2 And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
3 These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his own possession in their cities — Israelites, priests, Levites, Nethinim, and descendants of Solomon’s servants.)
4 Also in Jerusalem dwelt <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin. The children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;

18 All the Levites in the holy city <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> two hundred and eighty-four.
19 Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren who kept the gates, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> one hundred and seventy-two.
20 And the rest of Israel, of the priests <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Levites, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance.
21 But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gishpa <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> over the Nethinim.
22 Also the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers in charge of the service of the house of God.
23 For <font color="#999999"><em>it was</em></font> the king’s command concerning them that a certain portion should be for the singers, a quota day by day.
24 Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> the king’s deputy in all matters concerning the people.
<br><font color="#999999">The People Dwelling Outside Jerusalem</font><br><br>25 And as for the villages with their fields, <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> of the children of Judah dwelt in Kirjath Arba and its villages, Dibon and its villages, Jekabzeel and its villages;

7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Jedaiah. These <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> the heads of the priests and their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
8 Moreover the Levites <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Mattaniah <font color="#999999"><em>who led</em></font> the thanksgiving <font color="#999999"><em>psalms,</em></font> he and his brethren.
9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, <font color="#999999"><em>stood</em></font> across from them in <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> duties.
10 Jeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot Eliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada,
11 Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.
12 Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of the fathers’ <font color="#999999"><em>houses were:</em></font> of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
14 of Melichu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
17 of Abijah, Zichri; <font color="#999999"><em>the son</em></font> of Minjamin; of Moadiah, Piltai;
18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
19 of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
22 During the reign of Darius the Persian, a record <font color="#999999"><em>was also kept</em></font> of the Levites and priests <font color="#999999"><em>who had been</em></font> heads of their fathers’ <font color="#999999"><em>houses</em></font> in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua.
23 The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers’ <font color="#999999"><em>houses</em></font> until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib, <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> written in the book of the chronicles.
24 And the heads of the Levites <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers across from them, to praise <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> give thanks, group alternating with group, according to the command of David the man of God.
25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates.
26 These <font color="#999999"><em>lived</em></font> in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
<br><font color="#999999">Nehemiah Dedicates the Wall</font><br><br>27 Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings and singing, <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> cymbals and stringed instruments and harps.
28 And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,
29 from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem.
30 Then the priests and Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
31 So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs. <font color="#999999"><em>One</em></font> went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse Gate.
32 After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,
33 and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
35 and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets — Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
36 and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe <font color="#999999"><em>went</em></font> before them.
37 By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up the stairs of the City of David, on the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of David, as far as the Water Gate eastward.
38 The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite <font color="#999999"><em>way,</em></font> and I <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> behind them with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall,
39 and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison.
40 So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and the half of the rulers with me;
41 and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Hananiah, with trumpets;
42 also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director.
43 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
<br><font color="#999999">Temple Responsibilities</font><br><br>44 And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered.
45 Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, according to the command of David <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Solomon his son.
46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old <font color="#999999"><em>there were</em></font> chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
47 In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated <font color="#999999"><em>holy things</em></font> for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> for the children of Aaron.

<br><font color="#999999">Principles of Separation</font><br><br>1 On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God,
2 because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
3 So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.
<br><font color="#999999">The Reforms of Nehemiah</font><br><br>4 Now before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> allied with Tobiah.
5 And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded <font color="#999999"><em>to be given</em></font> to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests.
6 But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king,
7 and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.
8 And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room.
9 Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.
10 I also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given <font color="#999999"><em>them;</em></font> for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field.
11 So I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their place.
12 Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse.
13 And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> to distribute to their brethren.
14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!
15 In those days I saw <font color="#999999"><em>people</em></font> in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all <font color="#999999"><em>kinds of</em></font> burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> about the day on which they were selling provisions.
16 Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day?
18 Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
19 So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> of my servants at the gates, <font color="#999999"><em>so that</em></font> no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day.
20 Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
21 Then I warned them, and said to them, “Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do <font color="#999999"><em>so</em></font> again, I will lay hands on you!” From that time on they came no <font color="#999999"><em>more</em></font> on the Sabbath.
22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, <font color="#999999"><em>concerning</em></font> this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy!
23 In those days I also saw Jews <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> Moab.
24 And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people.
25 So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, <font color="#999999"><em>saying,</em></font> “You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves.
26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin.
27 Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women?”
28 And <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.
29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
30 Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also assigned duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service,
31 and <font color="#999999"><em>to bringing</em></font> the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times. Remember me, O my God, for good!
