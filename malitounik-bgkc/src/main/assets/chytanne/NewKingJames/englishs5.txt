<br><font color="#999999">The Previous Command to Enter Canaan</font><br><br>1 These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
2 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> eleven days’ <font color="#999999"><em>journey</em></font> from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.
3 Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <font color="#999999"><em>day</em></font> of the month, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord had given him as commandments to them,
4 after he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei.
5 On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying,
6 “The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.
7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring <font color="#999999"><em>places</em></font> in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.
8 See, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to your fathers — to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — to give to them and their descendants after them.’
<br><font color="#999999">Tribal Leaders Appointed</font><br><br>9 “And I spoke to you at that time, saying: ‘I alone am not able to bear you.
10 The Lord your God has multiplied you, and here you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> today, as the stars of heaven in multitude.
11 May the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times more numerous than you are, and bless you as He has promised you!
12 How can I alone bear your problems and your burdens and your complaints?
13 Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.’
14 And you answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have told <font color="#999999"><em>us</em></font> to do <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> good.’
15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made them heads over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes.
16 “Then I commanded your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear <font color="#999999"><em>the cases</em></font> between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him.
17 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid in any man’s presence, for the judgment <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God’s. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.’
18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
<br><font color="#999999">Israel’s Refusal to Enter the Land</font><br><br>19 “So we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as the Lord our God had commanded us. Then we came to Kadesh Barnea.
20 And I said to you, ‘You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.
21 Look, the Lord your God has set the land before you; go up <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> possess <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> as the Lord God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be discouraged.’
22 “And every one of you came near to me and said, ‘Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.’
23 “The plan pleased me well; so I took twelve of your men, one man from <font color="#999999"><em>each</em></font> tribe.
24 And they departed and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
25 They also took <font color="#999999"><em>some</em></font> of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, ‘<font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> a good land which the Lord our God is giving us.’
26 “Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God;
27 and you complained in your tents, and said, ‘Because the Lord hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
28 Where can we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our hearts, saying, “The people <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> greater and taller than we; the cities <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> great and fortified up to heaven; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.” ’
29 “Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, or afraid of them.
30 The Lord your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
31 and in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.’
32 Yet, for all that, you did not believe the Lord your God,
33 who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to pitch your tents, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day.
<br><font color="#999999">The Penalty for Israel’s Rebellion</font><br><br>34 “And the Lord heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and took an oath, saying,
35 ‘Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land of which I swore to give to your fathers,
36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked, because he wholly followed the Lord.’
37 The Lord was also angry with me for your sakes, saying, ‘Even you shall not go in there.
38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
39 ‘Moreover your little ones and your children, who you say will be victims, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
40 But <font color="#999999"><em>as for</em></font> you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.’
41 “Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord; we will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.’ And when everyone of you had girded on his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the mountain.
42 “And the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> not among you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.” ’
43 So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the command of the Lord, and presumptuously went up into the mountain.
44 And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and drove you back from Seir to Hormah.
45 Then you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.
46 “So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you spent <font color="#999999"><em>there.</em></font>

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Desert Years</font><br><br>1 “Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness of the Way of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke to me, and we skirted Mount Seir for many days.
2 “And the Lord spoke to me, saying:
3 ‘You have skirted this mountain long enough; turn northward.
4 And command the people, saying, “You <font color="#999999"><em>are about to</em></font> pass through the territory of your brethren, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully.
5 Do not meddle with them, for I will not give you <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> of their land, no, not so much as one footstep, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a possession.
6 You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.
7 “For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your trudging through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>has been</em></font> with you; you have lacked nothing.” ’
8 “And when we passed beyond our brethren, the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the road of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we turned and passed by way of the Wilderness of Moab.
9 Then the Lord said to me, ‘Do not harass Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> of their land <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a possession, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a possession.’ ”
10 (The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim.
11 They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
12 The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave them.)
13 “ ‘Now rise and cross over the Valley of the Zered.’ So we crossed over the Valley of the Zered.
14 And the time we took to come from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the Valley of the Zered <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, just as the Lord had sworn to them.
15 For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed.
16 “So it was, when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people,
17 that the Lord spoke to me, saying:
18 ‘This day you are to cross over at Ar, the boundary of Moab.
19 And <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> you come near the people of Ammon, do not harass them or meddle with them, for I will not give you <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> of the land of the people of Ammon <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a possession.’ ”
20 (That was also regarded as a land of giants; giants formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
21 a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place,
22 just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this day.
23 And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza — the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)
24 “ ‘Rise, take your journey, and cross over the River Arnon. Look, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> and engage him in battle.
25 This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.’
<br><font color="#999999">King Sihon Defeated</font><br><br>26 “And I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
27 ‘Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the road, and I will turn neither to the right nor to the left.
28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,
29 just as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which the Lord our God is giving us.’
30 “But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> this day.
31 “And the Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to possess <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> that you may inherit his land.’
32 Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz.
33 And the Lord our God delivered him over to us; so we defeated him, his sons, and all his people.
34 We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining.
35 We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we took.
36 From Aroer, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the bank of the River Arnon, and <font color="#999999"><em>from</em></font> the city that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the ravine, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us; the Lord our God delivered all to us.
37 Only you did not go near the land of the people of Ammon — anywhere along the River Jabbok, or to the cities of the mountains, or wherever the Lord our God had forbidden us.

===
<br><font color="#999999">King Og Defeated</font><br><br>1 “Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan; and Og king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
2 And the Lord said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’
3 “So the Lord our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with all his people, and we attacked him until he had no survivors remaining.
4 And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
5 All these cities <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns.
6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
7 But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.
8 “And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> on this side of the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon
9 (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),
10 all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
11 “For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants. Indeed his bedstead <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> an iron bedstead. (<font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> it not in Rabbah of the people of Ammon?) Nine cubits <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> its length and four cubits its width, according to the standard cubit.
<br><font color="#999999">The Land East of the Jordan Divided</font><br><br>12 “And this land, <font color="#999999"><em>which</em></font> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.
13 The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the giants.
14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair, to this day.)
15 “Also I gave Gilead to Machir.
16 And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as <font color="#999999"><em>the</em></font> border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the people of Ammon;
17 the plain also, with the Jordan as <font color="#999999"><em>the</em></font> border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.
18 “Then I commanded you at that time, saying: ‘The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. All you men of valor shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel.
19 But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall stay in your cities which I have given you,
20 until the Lord has given rest to your brethren as to you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God is giving them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.’
21 “And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms through which you pass.
22 You must not fear them, for the Lord your God Himself fights for you.’
<br><font color="#999999">Moses Forbidden to Enter the Land</font><br><br>23 “Then I pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying:
24 ‘O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> in heaven or on earth who can do <font color="#999999"><em>anything</em></font> like Your works and Your mighty <font color="#999999"><em>deeds?</em></font>
25 I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.’
26 “But the Lord was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. So the Lord said to me: ‘Enough of that! Speak no more to Me of this matter.
27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.
28 But command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see.’
29 “So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor.

===
<br><font color="#999999">Moses Commands Obedience</font><br><br>1 “Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I teach you to observe, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers is giving you.
2 You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.
3 Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor; for the Lord your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor.
4 But you who held fast to the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> alive today, every one of you.
5 “Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should act according <font color="#999999"><em>to them</em></font> in the land which you go to possess.
6 Therefore be careful to observe <font color="#999999"><em>them;</em></font> for this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, ‘Surely this great nation <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a wise and understanding people.’
7 “For what great nation <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> that has God <font color="#999999"><em>so</em></font> near to it, as the Lord our God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> to us, for whatever <font color="#999999"><em>reason</em></font> we may call upon Him?
8 And what great nation <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> that has <font color="#999999"><em>such</em></font> statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this law which I set before you this day?
9 Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. And teach them to your children and your grandchildren,
10 <font color="#999999"><em>especially concerning</em></font> the day you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said to me, ‘Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> they may teach their children.’
11 “Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
12 And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> only <font color="#999999"><em>heard</em></font> a voice.
13 So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
14 And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might observe them in the land which you cross over to possess.
<br><font color="#999999">Beware of Idolatry</font><br><br>15 “Take careful heed to yourselves, for you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,
16 lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure: the likeness of male or female,
17 the likeness of any animal that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the earth or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,
18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or the likeness of any fish that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the water beneath the earth.
19 And <font color="#999999"><em>take heed,</em></font> lest you lift your eyes to heaven, and <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> you see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, you feel driven to worship them and serve them, which the Lord your God has given to all the peoples under the whole heaven as a heritage.
20 But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be His people, an inheritance, as you are this day.
21 Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I would not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
22 But I must die in this land, I must not cross over the Jordan; but you shall cross over and possess that good land.
23 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you.
24 For the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a consuming fire, a jealous God.
25 “When you beget children and grandchildren and have grown old in the land, and act corruptly and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God to provoke Him to anger,
26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will soon utterly perish from the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess; you will not prolong <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> days in it, but will be utterly destroyed.
27 And the Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the Lord will drive you.
28 And there you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
29 But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find <font color="#999999"><em>Him</em></font> if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
30 When you are in distress, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, when you turn to the Lord your God and obey His voice
31 (for the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a merciful God), He will not forsake you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.
32 “For ask now concerning the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and <font color="#999999"><em>ask</em></font> from one end of heaven to the other, whether <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> great <font color="#999999"><em>thing</em></font> like this has happened, or <font color="#999999"><em>anything</em></font> like it has been heard.
33 Did <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> people <font color="#999999"><em>ever</em></font> hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
34 Or did God <font color="#999999"><em>ever</em></font> try to go <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> take for Himself a nation from the midst of <font color="#999999"><em>another</em></font> nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
35 To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord Himself <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God; <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> none other besides Him.
36 Out of heaven He let you hear His voice, that He might instruct you; on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire.
37 And because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them; and He brought you out of Egypt with His Presence, with His mighty power,
38 driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> an inheritance, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> this day.
39 Therefore know this day, and consider <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> in your heart, that the Lord Himself <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no other.
40 You shall therefore keep His statutes and His commandments which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> days in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for all time.”
<br><font color="#999999">Cities of Refuge East of the Jordan</font><br><br>41 Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,
42 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without having hated him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
43 Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
<br><font color="#999999">Introduction to God’s Law</font><br><br>44 Now this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
45 These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt,
46 on this side of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel defeated after they came out of Egypt.
47 And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,
48 from Aroer, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> on the bank of the River Arnon, even to Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),
49 and all the plain on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.

<br><font color="#999999">The Ten Commandments Reviewed</font><br><br>1 And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your hearing today, that you may learn them and be careful to observe them.
2 The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
3 The Lord did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, those who <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> here today, all of us who <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> alive.
4 The Lord talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire.
5 I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up the mountain. <font color="#999999"><em>He</em></font> said:
6 ‘I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
7 ‘You shall have no other gods before Me.
8 ‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image — any likeness <font color="#999999"><em>of anything</em></font> that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in heaven above, or that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the earth beneath, or that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the water under the earth;
9 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth <font color="#999999"><em>generations</em></font> of those who hate Me,
10 but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
11 ‘You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> guiltless who takes His name in vain.
12 ‘Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you.
13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
14 but the seventh day <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the Sabbath of the Lord your God. <font color="#999999"><em>In it</em></font> you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
15 And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
16 ‘Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may be well with you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
17 ‘You shall not murder.
18 ‘You shall not commit adultery.
19 ‘You shall not steal.
20 ‘You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
21 ‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife; and you shall not desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your neighbor’s.’
22 “These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly, in the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
<br><font color="#999999">The People Afraid of God’s Presence</font><br><br>23 “So it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.
24 And you said: ‘Surely the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man; yet he <font color="#999999"><em>still</em></font> lives.
25 Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore, then we shall die.
26 For who <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we <font color="#999999"><em>have,</em></font> and lived?
27 You go near and hear all that the Lord our God may say, and tell us all that the Lord our God says to you, and we will hear and do <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>’
28 “Then the Lord heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me: ‘I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They are right <font color="#999999"><em>in</em></font> all that they have spoken.
29 Oh, that they had such a heart in them that they would fear Me and always keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!
30 Go and say to them, “Return to your tents.”
31 But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> in the land which I am giving them to possess.’
32 “Therefore you shall be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
33 You shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God has commanded you, that you may live and <font color="#999999"><em>that it may be</em></font> well with you, and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> you may prolong <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> days in the land which you shall possess.

<br><font color="#999999">The Greatest Commandment</font><br><br>1 “Now this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the commandment, <font color="#999999"><em>and these are</em></font> the statutes and judgments which the Lord your God has commanded to teach you, that you may observe <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> in the land which you are crossing over to possess,
2 that you may fear the Lord your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
3 Therefore hear, O Israel, and be careful to observe <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly as the Lord God of your fathers has promised you — ‘a land flowing with milk and honey.’
4 “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> one!
5 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
6 “And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart.
7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
<br><font color="#999999">Caution Against Disobedience</font><br><br>10 “So it shall be, when the Lord your God brings you into the land of which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you large and beautiful cities which you did not build,
11 houses full of all good things, which you did not fill, hewn-out wells which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant — when you have eaten and are full —
12 <font color="#999999"><em>then</em></font> beware, lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
13 You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him, and shall take oaths in His name.
14 You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you
15 (for the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a jealous God among you), lest the anger of the Lord your God be aroused against you and destroy you from the face of the earth.
16 “You shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted <font color="#999999"><em>Him</em></font> in Massah.
17 You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, His testimonies, and His statutes which He has commanded you.
18 And you shall do <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land of which the Lord swore to your fathers,
19 to cast out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has spoken.
20 “When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What <font color="#999999"><em>is the meaning of</em></font> the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which the Lord our God has commanded you?’
21 then you shall say to your son: ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
22 and the Lord showed signs and wonders before our eyes, great and severe, against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household.
23 Then He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the land of which He swore to our fathers.
24 And the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[i]</i></span>this day.

<br><font color="#999999">A Chosen People</font><br><br>1 “When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you go to possess, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you,
2 and when the Lord your God delivers them over to you, you shall conquer them <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them.
3 Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son.
4 For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; so the anger of the Lord will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly.
5 But thus you shall deal with them: you shall destroy their altars, and break down their <font color="#999999"><em>sacred</em></font> pillars, and cut down their wooden images, and burn their carved images with fire.
6 “For you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth.
7 The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples;
8 but because the Lord loves you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
9 “Therefore know that the Lord your God, He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments;
10 and He repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack with him who hates Him; He will repay him to his face.
11 Therefore you shall keep the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments which I command you today, to observe them.
<br><font color="#999999">Blessings of Obedience</font><br><br>12 “Then it shall come to pass, because you listen to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers.

14 You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be a male or female barren among you or among your livestock.
15 And the Lord will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> on all those who hate you.
16 Also you shall destroy all the peoples whom the Lord your God delivers over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their gods, for that <font color="#999999"><em>will</em></font> <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> a snare to you.
17 “If you should say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?’ —
18 you shall not be afraid of them, <font color="#999999"><em>but</em></font> you shall remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:
19 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out. So shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
20 Moreover the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left, who hide themselves from you, are destroyed.
21 You shall not be terrified of them; for the Lord your God, the great and awesome God, <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> among you.
22 And the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you little by little; you will be unable to destroy them at once, lest the beasts of the field become <font color="#999999"><em>too</em></font> numerous for you.
23 But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, and will inflict defeat upon them until they are destroyed.
24 And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will destroy their name from under heaven; no one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.
25 You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold <font color="#999999"><em>that is</em></font> on them, nor take <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an abomination to the Lord your God.
26 Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be doomed to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> an accursed thing.

2 And you shall remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> test you, to know what <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.
3 So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every <font color="#999999"><em>word</em></font> that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.
4 Your garments did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years.
5 You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, <font color="#999999"><em>so</em></font> the Lord your God chastens you.
6 “Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.
7 For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, that flow out of valleys and hills;
8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;
9 a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing; a land whose stones <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
10 When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which He has given you.
11 “Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments, His judgments, and His statutes which I command you today,

16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers did not know, that He might humble you and that He might test you, to do you good in the end —
17 then you say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth.’
18 “And you shall remember the Lord your God, for <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> He who gives you power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> this day.

3 Therefore understand today that the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> He who goes over before you <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> a consuming fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; so you shall drive them out and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has said to you.
4 “Do not think in your heart, after the Lord your God has cast them out before you, saying, ‘Because of my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to possess this land’; but <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> because of the wickedness of these nations <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> the Lord is driving them out from before you.
5 <font color="#999999"><em>It is</em></font> not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> you go in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> the Lord your God drives them out from before you, and that He may fulfill the word which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
6 Therefore understand that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a stiff-necked people.
7 “Remember! Do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord.
8 Also in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry <font color="#999999"><em>enough</em></font> with you to have destroyed you.
9 When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
10 Then the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> all the words which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
11 And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
12 “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molded image.’
13 “Furthermore the Lord spoke to me, saying, ‘I have seen this people, and indeed they are a stiff-necked people.
14 Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’
15 “So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> in my two hands.
16 And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God — had made for yourselves a molded calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which the Lord had commanded you.
17 Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
18 And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger.
19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord was angry with you, to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me at that time also.
20 And the Lord was very angry with Aaron <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> would have destroyed him; so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
21 Then I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> ground <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.
22 “Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath.
23 Likewise, when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, ‘Go up and possess the land which I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice.
24 You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.
25 “Thus I prostrated myself before the Lord; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because the Lord had said He would destroy you.
26 Therefore I prayed to the Lord, and said: ‘O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
27 Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin,
28 lest the land from which You brought us should say, “Because the Lord was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.”
29 Yet they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm.’

<br><font color="#999999">The Second Pair of Tablets</font><br><br>1 “At that time the Lord said to me, ‘Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of wood.
2 And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you shall put them in the ark.’
3 “So I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.
4 And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments, which the Lord had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me.
5 Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, just as the Lord commanded me.”
6 (Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his stead.
7 From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of water.
8 At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless in His name, to this day.
9 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his inheritance, just as the Lord your God promised him.)
10 “As at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; the Lord also heard me at that time, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> the Lord chose not to destroy you.
11 Then the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, begin <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.’

14 Indeed heaven and the highest heavens belong to the Lord your God, <font color="#999999"><em>also</em></font> the earth with all that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in it.
15 The Lord delighted only in your fathers, to love them; and He chose their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> this day.
16 Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no longer.
17 For the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe.
18 He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.
19 Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
20 You shall fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him, and to Him you shall hold fast, and take oaths in His name.

12 a land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year.
13 ‘And it shall be that if you earnestly obey My commandments which I command you today, to love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,
14 then I will give <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
15 And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.’
16 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them,
17 lest the Lord’s anger be aroused against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly from the good land which the Lord is giving you.
18 “Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
19 You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
20 And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
21 that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, like the days of the heavens above the earth.
22 “For if you carefully keep all these commandments which I command you to do — to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him —
23 then the Lord will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess greater and mightier nations than yourselves.
24 Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the Western Sea, shall be your territory.
25 No man shall be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, just as He has said to you.
26 “Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:
27 the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you today;
28 and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you today, to go after other gods which you have not known.
29 Now it shall be, when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
30 <font color="#999999"><em>Are</em></font> they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the terebinth trees of Moreh?
31 For you will cross over the Jordan and go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you, and you will possess it and dwell in it.
32 And you shall be careful to observe all the statutes and judgments which I set before you today.

===
<br><font color="#999999">A Prescribed Place of Worship</font><br><br>1 “These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the statutes and judgments which you shall be careful to observe in the land which the Lord God of your fathers is giving you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth.
2 You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
3 And you shall destroy their altars, break their <font color="#999999"><em>sacred</em></font> pillars, and burn their wooden images with fire; you shall cut down the carved images of their gods and destroy their names from that place.
4 You shall not worship the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> such <font color="#999999"><em>things.</em></font>
5 “But you shall seek the place where the Lord your God chooses, out of all your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go.
6 There you shall take your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, your vowed offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
7 And there you shall eat before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice in all to which you have put your hand, you and your households, in which the Lord your God has blessed you.
8 “You shall not at all do as we are doing here today — every man doing whatever <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> right in his own eyes —
9 for as yet you have not come to the rest and the inheritance which the Lord your God is giving you.
10 But <font color="#999999"><em>when</em></font> you cross over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety,
11 then there will be the place where the Lord your God chooses to make His name abide. There you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, and all your choice offerings which you vow to the Lord.
12 And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> within your gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
13 Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;
14 but in the place which the Lord chooses, in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
15 “However, you may slaughter and eat meat within all your gates, whatever your heart desires, according to the blessing of the Lord your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and the deer alike.
16 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
17 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or your new wine or your oil, of the firstborn of your herd or your flock, of any of your offerings which you vow, of your freewill offerings, or of the heave offering of your hand.
18 But you must eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God chooses, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God in all to which you put your hands.
19 Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
20 “When the Lord your God enlarges your border as He has promised you, and you say, ‘Let me eat meat,’ because you long to eat meat, you may eat as much meat as your heart desires.
21 If the place where the Lord your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you may slaughter from your herd and from your flock which the Lord has given you, just as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your gates as much as your heart desires.
22 Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you may eat them; the unclean and the clean alike may eat them.
23 Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the life; you may not eat the life with the meat.
24 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
25 You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and your children after you, when you do <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right in the sight of the Lord.
26 Only the holy things which you have, and your vowed offerings, you shall take and go to the place which the Lord chooses.
27 And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the Lord your God, and you shall eat the meat.
28 Observe and obey all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you and your children after you forever, when you do <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> good and right in the sight of the Lord your God.
<br><font color="#999999">Beware of False Gods</font><br><br>29 “When the Lord your God cuts off from before you the nations which you go to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land,
30 take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods? I also will do likewise.’
31 You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way; for every abomination to the Lord which He hates they have done to their gods; for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
32 “Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.

2 and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods’ — which you have not known — ‘and let us serve them,’
3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for the Lord your God is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
4 You shall walk after the Lord your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments and obey His voice; you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him.
5 But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has spoken in order to turn <font color="#999999"><em>you</em></font> away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of bondage, to entice you from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk. So you shall put away the evil from your midst.
6 “If your brother, the son of your mother, your son or your daughter, the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, secretly entices you, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,
7 of the gods of the people which <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> all around you, near to you or far off from you, from <font color="#999999"><em>one</em></font> end of the earth to the <font color="#999999"><em>other</em></font> end of the earth,
8 you shall not consent to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him;
9 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
10 And you shall stone him with stones until he dies, because he sought to entice you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
11 So all Israel shall hear and fear, and not again do such wickedness as this among you.
12 “If you hear someone in one of your cities, which the Lord your God gives you to dwell in, saying,
13 ‘Corrupt men have gone out from among you and enticed the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods” ’ — which you have not known —

15 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it, all that is in it and its livestock — with the edge of the sword.
16 And you shall gather all its plunder into the middle of the street, and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder, for the Lord your God. It shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
17 So none of the accursed things shall remain in your hand, that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy, have compassion on you and multiply you, just as He swore to your fathers,
18 because you have listened to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep all His commandments which I command you today, to do <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right in the eyes of the Lord your God.

6 And you may eat every animal with cloven hooves, having the hoof split into two parts, <font color="#999999"><em>and that</em></font> chews the cud, among the animals.
7 Nevertheless, of those that chew the cud or have cloven hooves, you shall not eat, <font color="#999999"><em>such as</em></font> these: the camel, the hare, and the rock hyrax; for they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves; they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> unclean for you.
8 Also the swine is unclean for you, because it has cloven hooves, yet <font color="#999999"><em>does</em></font> not <font color="#999999"><em>chew</em></font> the cud; you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcasses.
9 “These you may eat of all that <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in the waters: you may eat all that have fins and scales.

14 every raven after its kind;
15 the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after their kinds;
16 the little owl, the screech owl, the white owl,
17 the jackdaw, the carrion vulture, the fisher owl,
18 the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe and the bat.
19 “Also every creeping thing that flies is unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.

3 Of a foreigner you may require <font color="#999999"><em>it;</em></font> but you shall give up your claim to what is owed by your brother,
4 except when there may be no poor among you; for the Lord will greatly bless you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> an inheritance —

9 Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,’ and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to the Lord against you, and it become sin among you.
10 You shall surely give to him, and your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the Lord your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand.

19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and be careful to observe all the words of this law and these statutes,
20 that his heart may not be lifted above his brethren, that he may not turn aside from the commandment <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> the right hand or <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> the left, and that he may prolong <font color="#999999"><em>his</em></font> days in his kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel.

<br><font color="#999999">The Portion of the Priests and Levites</font><br><br>1 “The priests, the Levites — all the tribe of Levi — shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and His portion.
2 Therefore they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; the Lord is their inheritance, as He said to them.
3 “And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> bull or sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach.
4 The firstfruits of your grain and your new wine and your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
5 For the Lord your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to minister in the name of the Lord, him and his sons forever.
6 “So if a Levite comes from any of your gates, from where he dwells among all Israel, and comes with all the desire of his mind to the place which the Lord chooses,
7 then he may serve in the name of the Lord his God as all his brethren the Levites <font color="#999999"><em>do,</em></font> who stand there before the Lord.
8 They shall have equal portions to eat, besides what comes from the sale of his inheritance.
<br><font color="#999999">Avoid Wicked Customs</font><br><br>9 “When you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominations of those nations.
10 There shall not be found among you <font color="#999999"><em>anyone</em></font> who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, <font color="#999999"><em>or one</em></font> who practices witchcraft, <font color="#999999"><em>or</em></font> a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer,
11 or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.
12 For all who do these things <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you.
13 You shall be blameless before the Lord your God.
14 For these nations which you will dispossess listened to soothsayers and diviners; but as for you, the Lord your God has not appointed such for you.
<br><font color="#999999">A New Prophet Like Moses</font><br><br>15 “The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear,
16 according to all you desired of the Lord your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God, nor let me see this great fire anymore, lest I die.’
17 “And the Lord said to me: ‘What they have spoken is good.
18 I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren, and will put My words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him.
19 And it shall be <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> whoever will not hear My words, which He speaks in My name, I will require <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> of him.
20 But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.’
21 And if you say in your heart, ‘How shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken?’ —
22 when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing does not happen or come to pass, that <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the thing which the Lord has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.

<br><font color="#999999">Three Cities of Refuge</font><br><br>1 “When the Lord your God has cut off the nations whose land the Lord your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses,
2 you shall separate three cities for yourself in the midst of your land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
3 You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer may flee there.
4 “And this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, not having hated him in time past —
5 as when <font color="#999999"><em>a man</em></font> goes to the woods with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies — he shall flee to one of these cities and live;
6 lest the avenger of blood, while his anger is hot, pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and kill him, though he <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> not deserving of death, since he had not hated the victim in time past.
7 Therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall separate three cities for yourself.’
8 “Now if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you the land which He promised to give to your fathers,
9 and if you keep all these commandments and do them, which I command you today, to love the Lord your God and to walk always in His ways, then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three,
10 lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the Lord your God is giving you <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> an inheritance, and <font color="#999999"><em>thus</em></font> guilt of bloodshed be upon you.
11 “But if anyone hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises against him and strikes him mortally, so that he dies, and he flees to one of these cities,
12 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away <font color="#999999"><em>the guilt of</em></font> innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.

<br><font color="#999999">The Law Concerning Witnesses</font><br><br>15 “One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established.
16 If a false witness rises against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,
17 then both men in the controversy shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges who serve in those days.
18 And the judges shall make careful inquiry, and indeed, <font color="#999999"><em>if</em></font> the witness <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother,
19 then you shall do to him as he thought to have done to his brother; so you shall put away the evil from among you.
20 And those who remain shall hear and fear, and hereafter they shall not again commit such evil among you.
21 Your eye shall not pity: life <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

<br><font color="#999999">Principles Governing Warfare</font><br><br>1 “When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
2 So it shall be, when you are on the verge of battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people.
3 And he shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel: Today you are on the verge of battle with your enemies. Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and do not tremble or be terrified because of them;
4 for the Lord your God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’
5 “Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying: ‘What man <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.
6 Also what man <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it.
7 And what man <font color="#999999"><em>is there</em></font> who is betrothed to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man marry her.’
8 “The officers shall speak further to the people, and say, ‘What man <font color="#999999"><em>is there who is</em></font> fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest the heart of his brethren faint like his heart.’
9 And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
10 “When you go near a city to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of peace to it.
11 And it shall be that if they accept your offer of peace, and open to you, then all the people <font color="#999999"><em>who are</em></font> found in it shall be placed under tribute to you, and serve you.
12 Now if <font color="#999999"><em>the city</em></font> will not make peace with you, but war against you, then you shall besiege it.
13 And when the Lord your God delivers it into your hands, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword.
14 But the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoil, you shall plunder for yourself; and you shall eat the enemies’ plunder which the Lord your God gives you.
15 Thus you shall do to all the cities <font color="#999999"><em>which are</em></font> very far from you, which <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not of the cities of these nations.
16 “But of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive,
17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the Lord your God has commanded you,
18 lest they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done for their gods, and you sin against the Lord your God.
19 “When you besiege a city for a long time, while making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; if you can eat of them, do not cut them down to use in the siege, for the tree of the field <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> man’s <font color="#999999"><em>food.</em></font>
20 Only the trees which you know <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, to build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it is subdued.

<br><font color="#999999">The Law Concerning Unsolved Murder</font><br><br>1 “If <font color="#999999"><em>anyone</em></font> is found slain, lying in the field in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> it is not known who killed him,
2 then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure <font color="#999999"><em>the distance</em></font> from the slain man to the surrounding cities.
3 And it shall be <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> the elders of the city nearest to the slain man will take a heifer which has not been worked <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> which has not pulled with a yoke.
4 The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with flowing water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
5 Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the Lord; by their word every controversy and every assault shall be <font color="#999999"><em>settled.</em></font>
6 And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain <font color="#999999"><em>man</em></font> shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
7 Then they shall answer and say, ‘Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen <font color="#999999"><em>it.</em></font>
8 Provide atonement, O Lord, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel.’ And atonement shall be provided on their behalf for the blood.
9 So you shall put away the <font color="#999999"><em>guilt of</em></font> innocent blood from among you when you do <font color="#999999"><em>what is</em></font> right in the sight of the Lord.
<br><font color="#999999">Female Captives</font><br><br>10 “When you go out to war against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your hand, and you take them captive,

12 then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails.
13 She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a full month; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
14 And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall set her free, but you certainly shall not sell her for money; you shall not treat her brutally, because you have humbled her.

16 then it shall be, on the day he bequeaths his possessions to his sons, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> he must not bestow firstborn status on the son of the loved wife in preference to the son of the unloved, the <font color="#999999"><em>true</em></font> firstborn.
17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the unloved wife <font color="#999999"><em>as</em></font> the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his.

19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his city.
20 And they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’
21 Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.

3 You shall write on them all the words of this law, when you have crossed over, that you may enter the land which the Lord your God is giving you, ‘a land flowing with milk and honey,’ just as the Lord God of your fathers promised you.
4 Therefore it shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> on Mount Ebal you shall set up these stones, which I command you today, and you shall whitewash them with lime.

6 You shall build with whole stones the altar of the Lord your God, and offer burnt offerings on it to the Lord your God.
7 You shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before the Lord your God.
8 And you shall write very plainly on the stones all the words of this law.”

52 “They shall besiege you at all your gates until your high and fortified walls, in which you trust, come down throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you at all your gates throughout all your land which the Lord your God has given you.
53 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom the Lord your God has given you, in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you.
54 The sensitive and very refined man among you will be hostile toward his brother, toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the rest of his children whom he leaves behind,
55 so that he will not give any of them the flesh of his children whom he will eat, because he has nothing left in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you at all your gates.
56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and sensitivity, <span class="sup2"><i href="#note">[s]</i></span>will refuse to the husband of her bosom, and to her son and her daughter,
57 her placenta which comes out from between her feet and her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of everything in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you at all your gates.
58 “If you do not carefully observe all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, THE LORD YOUR GOD,

60 Moreover He will bring back on you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall cling to you.
61 Also every sickness and every plague, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not written in this Book of the Law, will the Lord bring upon you until you are destroyed.
62 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven in multitude, because you would not obey the voice of the Lord your God.
63 And it shall be, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> just as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good and multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to nothing; and you shall be plucked from off the land which you go to possess.
64 “Then the Lord will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known — wood and stone.
65 And among those nations you shall find no rest, nor shall the sole of your foot have a resting place; but there the Lord will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and anguish of soul.
66 Your life shall hang in doubt before you; you shall fear day and night, and have no assurance of life.
67 In the morning you shall say, ‘Oh, that it were evening!’ And at evening you shall say, ‘Oh, that it were morning!’ because of the fear which terrifies your heart, and because of the sight which your eyes see.
68 “And the Lord will take you back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I said to you, ‘You shall never see it again.’ And there you shall be offered for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy <font color="#999999"><em>you.</em></font>”

<br><font color="#999999">The Covenant Renewed in Moab</font><br><br>1 These <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.
2 Now Moses called all Israel and said to them: “You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land —
3 the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders.
4 Yet the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to this <font color="#999999"><em>very</em></font> day.
5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.
6 You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or <font color="#999999"><em>similar</em></font> drink, that you may know that I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> the Lord your God.
7 And when you came to this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we conquered them.
8 We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh.
9 Therefore keep the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
10 “All of you stand today before the Lord your God: your leaders and your tribes and your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel,
11 your little ones and your wives — also the stranger who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water —
12 that you may enter into covenant with the Lord your God, and into His oath, which the Lord your God makes with you today,
13 that He may establish you today as a people for Himself, and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> He may be God to you, just as He has spoken to you, and just as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
14 “I make this covenant and this oath, not with you alone,
15 but with <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> who stands here with us today before the Lord our God, as well as with <font color="#999999"><em>him</em></font> who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not here with us today
16 (for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by,
17 and you saw their abominations and their idols which <font color="#999999"><em>were</em></font> among them — wood and stone and silver and gold);
18 so that there may not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God, to go <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> serve the gods of these nations, and that there may not be among you a root bearing bitterness or wormwood;
19 and so it may not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall have peace, even though I follow the dictates of my heart’ — as though the drunkard could be included with the sober.
20 “The Lord would not spare him; for then the anger of the Lord and His jealousy would burn against that man, and every curse that is written in this book would settle on him, and the Lord would blot out his name from under heaven.
21 And the Lord would separate him from all the tribes of Israel for adversity, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law,
22 so that the coming generation of your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, would say, when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the Lord has laid on it:
23 ‘The whole land <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> brimstone, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His anger and His wrath.’
24 All nations would say, ‘Why has the Lord done so to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?’
25 Then <font color="#999999"><em>people</em></font> would say: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt;
26 for they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they did not know and that He had not given to them.
27 Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against this land, to bring on it every curse that is written in this book.
28 And the Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as <font color="#999999"><em>it is</em></font> this day.’
29 “The secret <font color="#999999"><em>things belong</em></font> to the Lord our God, but those <font color="#999999"><em>things which are</em></font> revealed <font color="#999999"><em>belong</em></font> to us and to our children forever, that <font color="#999999"><em>we</em></font> may do all the words of this law.

<br><font color="#999999">The Blessing of Returning to God</font><br><br>1 “Now it shall come to pass, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call <font color="#999999"><em>them</em></font> to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God drives you,
2 and you return to the Lord your God and obey His voice, according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul,
3 that the Lord your God will bring you back from captivity, and have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you.
4 If <font color="#999999"><em>any</em></font> of you are driven out to the farthest <font color="#999999"><em>parts</em></font> under heaven, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you.
5 Then the Lord your God will bring you to the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it. He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.
6 And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.
7 “Also the Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
8 And you will again obey the voice of the Lord and do all His commandments which I command you today.
9 The Lord your God will make you abound in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your land for good. For the Lord will again rejoice over you for good as He rejoiced over your fathers,
10 if you obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
<br><font color="#999999">The Choice of Life or Death</font><br><br>11 “For this commandment which I command you today <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not <font color="#999999"><em>too</em></font> mysterious for you, nor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> it far off.
12 It <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’
13 Nor <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’
14 But the word <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.
15 “See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil,
16 in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and the Lord your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess.
17 But if your heart turns away so that you do not hear, and are drawn away, and worship other gods and serve them,
18 I announce to you today that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess.
19 I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;
20 that you may love the Lord your God, that you may obey His voice, and that you may cling to Him, for He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your life and the length of your days; and that you may dwell in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Joshua the New Leader of Israel</font><br><br>1 Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
2 And he said to them: “I <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. Also the Lord has said to me, ‘You shall not cross over this Jordan.’
3 The Lord your God Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself crosses over before you, just as the Lord has said.
4 And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them.
5 The Lord will give them over to you, that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you.
6 Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the Lord your God, He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.”
7 Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.
8 And the Lord, He <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.”
<br><font color="#999999">The Law to Be Read Every Seven Years</font><br><br>9 So Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.
10 And Moses commanded them, saying: “At the end of <font color="#999999"><em>every</em></font> seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Tabernacles,
11 when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
12 Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the stranger who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God and carefully observe all the words of this law,
13 and <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess.”
<br><font color="#999999">Prediction of Israel’s Rebellion</font><br><br>14 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, the days approach when you must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that I may inaugurate him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting.
15 Now the Lord appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle.
16 And the Lord said to Moses: “Behold, you will rest with your fathers; and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they go <font color="#999999"><em>to be</em></font> among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.
17 Then My anger shall be aroused against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, ‘Have not these evils come upon us because our God <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not among us?’
18 And I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.
19 “Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.
20 When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant.
21 Then it shall be, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants, for I know the inclination of their behavior today, even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore <font color="#999999"><em>to give them.</em></font>”
22 Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
23 Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them, and I will be with you.”
24 So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book, when they were finished,
25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying:
26 “Take this Book of the Law, and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there as a witness against you;
27 for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. <font color="#999999"><em>If</em></font> today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the Lord, then how much more after my death?
28 Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
29 For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you. And evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.”
<br><font color="#999999">The Song of Moses</font><br><br>30 Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were ended:

===
<br><font color="#999999">The Song of Moses</font><br><br>1 “Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
2 Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As raindrops on the tender herb, And as showers on the grass.
3 For I proclaim the name of the Lord: Ascribe greatness to our God.
4 <font color="#999999"><em>He is</em></font> the Rock, His work <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> perfect; For all His ways <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> justice, A God of truth and without injustice; Righteous and upright <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> He.
5 “They have corrupted themselves; <font color="#999999"><em>They are</em></font> not His children, Because of their blemish: A perverse and crooked generation.
6 Do you thus deal with the Lord, O foolish and unwise people? <font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> He not your Father, <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> bought you? Has He not made you and established you?
7 “Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; Your elders, and they will tell you:
8 When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations, When He separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel.
9 For the Lord’s portion <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> His people; Jacob <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the place of His inheritance.
10 “He found him in a desert land And in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye.
11 As an eagle stirs up its nest, Hovers over its young, Spreading out its wings, taking them up, Carrying them on its wings,
12 <font color="#999999"><em>So</em></font> the Lord alone led him, And <font color="#999999"><em>there was</em></font> no foreign god with him.
13 “He made him ride in the heights of the earth, That he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him draw honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock;
14 Curds from the cattle, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs; And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the choicest wheat; And you drank wine, the blood of the grapes.
15 “But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; You grew fat, you grew thick, You are obese! Then he forsook God <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> made him, And scornfully esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
16 They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign <font color="#999999"><em>gods;</em></font> With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
17 They sacrificed to demons, not to God, <font color="#999999"><em>To gods</em></font> they did not know, To new <font color="#999999"><em>gods,</em></font> new arrivals That your fathers did not fear.
18 Of the Rock <font color="#999999"><em>who</em></font> begot you, you are unmindful, And have forgotten the God who fathered you.
19 “And when the Lord saw <font color="#999999"><em>it,</em></font> He spurned <font color="#999999"><em>them,</em></font> Because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.
20 And He said: ‘I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end <font color="#999999"><em>will be,</em></font> For they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a perverse generation, Children in whom <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> no faith.
21 They have provoked Me to jealousy by <font color="#999999"><em>what</em></font> is not God; They have moved Me to anger by their foolish idols. But I will provoke them to jealousy by <font color="#999999"><em>those who are</em></font> not a nation; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.
22 For a fire is kindled in My anger, And shall burn to the lowest hell; It shall consume the earth with her increase, And set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
23 ‘I will heap disasters on them; I will spend My arrows on them.
24 <font color="#999999"><em>They shall be</em></font> wasted with hunger, Devoured by pestilence and bitter destruction; I will also send against them the teeth of beasts, With the poison of serpents of the dust.
25 The sword shall destroy outside; <font color="#999999"><em>There shall be</em></font> terror within For the young man and virgin, The nursing child with the man of gray hairs.
26 I would have said, “I will dash them in pieces, I will make the memory of them to cease from among men,”
27 Had I not feared the wrath of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misunderstand, Lest they should say, “Our hand <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> high; And it is not the Lord who has done all this.” ’
28 “For they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> a nation void of counsel, Nor <font color="#999999"><em>is there any</em></font> understanding in them.
29 Oh, that they were wise, <font color="#999999"><em>that</em></font> they understood this, <font color="#999999"><em>That</em></font> they would consider their latter end!
30 How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the Lord had surrendered them?
31 For their rock <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves <font color="#999999"><em>being</em></font> judges.
32 For their vine <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> of the vine of Sodom And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> grapes of gall, Their clusters <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> bitter.
33 Their wine <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of cobras.
34 ‘<font color="#999999"><em>Is</em></font> this not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up among My treasures?
35 Vengeance is Mine, and recompense; Their foot shall slip in <font color="#999999"><em>due</em></font> time; For the day of their calamity <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> at hand, And the things to come hasten upon them.’
36 “For the Lord will judge His people And have compassion on His servants, When He sees that <font color="#999999"><em>their</em></font> power is gone, And <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no one <font color="#999999"><em>remaining,</em></font> bond or free.
37 He will say: ‘Where <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge?
38 Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise and help you, <font color="#999999"><em>And</em></font> be your refuge.
39 ‘Now see that I, <font color="#999999"><em>even</em></font> I, <font color="#999999"><em>am</em></font> He, And <font color="#999999"><em>there is</em></font> no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; Nor <font color="#999999"><em>is there any</em></font> who can deliver from My hand.
40 For I raise My hand to heaven, And say, “<font color="#999999"><em>As</em></font> I live forever,
41 If I whet My glittering sword, And My hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to My enemies, And repay those who hate Me.
42 I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword shall devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the heads of the leaders of the enemy.” ’
43 “Rejoice, O Gentiles, <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And render vengeance to His adversaries; He will provide atonement for His land <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> His people.”
44 So Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
45 Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
46 and he said to them: “Set your hearts on all the words which I testify among you today, which you shall command your children to be careful to observe — all the words of this law.
47 For it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> not a futile thing for you, because it <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> your life, and by this word you shall prolong <font color="#999999"><em>your</em></font> days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess.”
<br><font color="#999999">Moses to Die on Mount Nebo</font><br><br>48 Then the Lord spoke to Moses that very same day, saying:
49 “Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> in the land of Moab, across from Jericho; view the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel as a possession;
50 and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people;
51 because you trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin, because you did not hallow Me in the midst of the children of Israel.
52 Yet you shall see the land before <font color="#999999"><em>you,</em></font> though you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Moses’ Final Blessing on Israel</font><br><br>1 Now this <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
2 And he said: “The Lord came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came with ten thousands of saints; From His right hand <font color="#999999"><em>Came</em></font> a fiery law for them.
3 Yes, He loves the people; All His saints <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> in Your hand; They sit down at Your feet; <font color="#999999"><em>Everyone</em></font> receives Your words.
4 Moses commanded a law for us, A heritage of the congregation of Jacob.
5 And He was King in Jeshurun, When the leaders of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.
6 “Let Reuben live, and not die, <font color="#999999"><em>Nor</em></font> let his men be few.”
7 And this he said of Judah: “Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, And bring him to his people; Let his hands be sufficient for him, And may You be a help against his enemies.”
8 And of Levi he said: “<font color="#999999"><em>Let</em></font> Your Thummim and Your Urim <font color="#999999"><em>be</em></font> with Your holy one, Whom You tested at Massah, And with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah,
9 Who says of his father and mother, ‘I have not seen them’; Nor did he acknowledge his brothers, Or know his own children; For they have observed Your word And kept Your covenant.
10 They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, And Israel Your law. They shall put incense before You, And a whole burnt sacrifice on Your altar.
11 Bless his substance, Lord, And accept the work of his hands; Strike the loins of those who rise against him, And of those who hate him, that they rise not again.”
12 Of Benjamin he said: “The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him, <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> shelters him all the day long; And he shall dwell between His shoulders.”
13 And of Joseph he said: “Blessed of the Lord <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> his land, With the precious things of heaven, with the dew, And the deep lying beneath,
14 With the precious fruits of the sun, With the precious produce of the months,
15 With the best things of the ancient mountains, With the precious things of the everlasting hills,
16 With the precious things of the earth and its fullness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let <font color="#999999"><em>the blessing</em></font> come ‘on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him <font color="#999999"><em>who was</em></font> separate from his brothers.’
17 His glory <font color="#999999"><em>is like</em></font> a firstborn bull, And his horns <font color="#999999"><em>like</em></font> the horns of the wild ox; Together with them He shall push the peoples To the ends of the earth; They <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the thousands of Manasseh.”
18 And of Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, And Issachar in your tents!
19 They shall call the peoples <font color="#999999"><em>to</em></font> the mountain; There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; For they shall partake <font color="#999999"><em>of</em></font> the abundance of the seas And <font color="#999999"><em>of</em></font> treasures hidden in the sand.”
20 And of Gad he said: “Blessed <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> he who enlarges Gad; He dwells as a lion, And tears the arm and the crown of his head.
21 He provided the first <font color="#999999"><em>part</em></font> for himself, Because a lawgiver’s portion was reserved there. He came <font color="#999999"><em>with</em></font> the heads of the people; He administered the justice of the Lord, And His judgments with Israel.”
22 And of Dan he said: “Dan <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> a lion’s whelp; He shall leap from Bashan.”
23 And of Naphtali he said: “O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full of the blessing of the Lord, Possess the west and the south.”
24 And of Asher he said: “Asher <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> most blessed of sons; Let him be favored by his brothers, And let him dip his foot in oil.
25 Your sandals <font color="#999999"><em>shall be</em></font> iron and bronze; As your days, <font color="#999999"><em>so shall</em></font> your strength <font color="#999999"><em>be.</em></font>
26 “<font color="#999999"><em>There is</em></font> no one like the God of Jeshurun, <font color="#999999"><em>Who</em></font> rides the heavens to help you, And in His excellency on the clouds.
27 The eternal God <font color="#999999"><em>is your</em></font> refuge, And underneath <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> the everlasting arms; He will thrust out the enemy from before you, And will say, ‘Destroy!’
28 Then Israel shall dwell in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens shall also drop dew.
29 Happy <font color="#999999"><em>are</em></font> you, O Israel! Who <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> like you, a people saved by the Lord, The shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! Your enemies shall submit to you, And you shall tread down their high places.”

===
<br><font color="#999999">Moses Dies on Mount Nebo</font><br><br>1 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,
2 all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,
3 the South, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
4 Then the Lord said to him, “This <font color="#999999"><em>is</em></font> the land of which I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have caused you to see <font color="#999999"><em>it</em></font> with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”
5 So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord.
6 And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day.
7 Moses <font color="#999999"><em>was</em></font> one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished.
8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping <font color="#999999"><em>and</em></font> mourning for Moses ended.
9 Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
10 But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
11 in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land,
12 and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
